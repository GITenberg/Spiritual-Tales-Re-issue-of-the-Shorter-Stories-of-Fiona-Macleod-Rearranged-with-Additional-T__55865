<p>&ldquo;I like to think that these spiritual chronicles
might as well, in substance, have been told a
thousand years ago or be written a thousand
years hence. That Fisher still haunts the invisible
shadowy stream of human tears; those
mystic Spinners still ply their triple shuttles, and
the fair Weaver of Hope now as of yore and for
ever sends his rainbows adrift across the hearts
and through the minds of men.... These tales,
let me add, are not legendary mysteries but
legendary moralities. They are reflections from
the mirror that is often obscured but is never
dimmed. There is no mystery in them, or
anywhere; except the eternal mystery of beauty.&rdquo;

<p>The tales in this volume which have
not hitherto appeared are &ldquo;The
Melancholy of Ulad&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Hills of Ruel.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Awakening
of Angus Ogue&rdquo; is also for the first
time printed in book form, though
it appeared in the Winter number
of <i>The Evergreen</i>. Of the re-issued
stories &ldquo;The Anointed Man&rdquo; is
from <i>The Sin-Eater</i>, and the others
are from <i>The Washer of the Ford</i>.
As these tales have not been re-set,
they are, except in the matter of

<h3><i>NOTE</i></h3>
<p><i>This legendary romance is based upon
the ancient and still current (though often
contradictory) legends concerning Brighid, or
Bride, commonly known as &ldquo;Muime Chriosd&rdquo;&mdash;i.e.
the Foster-Mother of Christ. From the
universal honour and reverence in which she
was and is held&mdash;second only in this respect to
the Virgin herself&mdash;she is also called &ldquo;Mary
of the Gael.&rdquo; Another name, frequent in the
West, is &ldquo;Brighde-nam-Brat&rdquo;&mdash;i.e. St Bride of
the Mantle, a name explained in the course of
my legendary story. Brighid the Christian saint
should not, however, be confused with a much
earlier and remoter Brighid, the ancient Celtic
Muse of Song.</i></p>

<h3>I</h3>
<p>Before ever St Colum came across the Moyle
to the island of Iona, that was then by strangers
called Innis-nan-Dhruidhneach, the Isle of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
Druids, and by the natives Ioua, there lived
upon the south-east slope of Dun-I a poor
herdsman named D&ugrave;vach. Poor he was, for
sure, though it was not for this reason that he
could not win back to Ireland, green Banba, as
he called it: but because he was an exile thence,
and might never again smell the heather blowing
over Sliabh-Gorm in what of old was the
realm of Aoimag.</p>
<p>He was a prince in his own land, though
none on Iona save the Arch-Druid knew what
his name was. The high priest, however, knew
that D&ugrave;vach was the royal D&ugrave;ghall, called
D&ugrave;ghall Donn, the son of Hugh the King, the
son of Art, the son of Conn. In his youth he
had been accused of having done a wrong
against a noble maiden of the blood. When
her child was born he was made to swear
across her dead body that he would be true to
the daughter for whom she had given up her
life, that he would rear her in a holy place, but
away from Eir&eacute;, and that he would never set
foot within that land again. This was a bitter
thing for D&ugrave;ghall Donn to do: the more so as,
before the King, and the priests, and the people,
he swore by the Wind, and by the Moon, and

by the Sun, that he was guiltless of the thing
of which he was accused. There were many
there who believed him because of that sacred
oath: others, too, forasmuch as that Morna
the Princess had herself sworn to the same
effect. Moreover, there was Aodh of the
Golden Hair, a poet and seer, who avowed
that Morna had given birth to an immortal,
whose name would one day be as a moon
among the stars for glory. But the King
would not be appeased, though he spared the
life of his youngest son. So it was that, by
the advice of Aodh of the Druids, D&ugrave;ghall
Donn went northwards through the realm of
Clanadon and so to the sea-loch that was then
called Loc Feobal. There he took boat with
some wayfarers bound for Alba. But in the
Moyle a tempest arose, and the frail galley
was driven northward, and at sunrise was cast
like a fish, spent and dead, upon the south
end of Ioua, that is now Iona. Only two of
the mariners survived: D&ugrave;ghall Donn and the
little child. This was at the place where, on
a day of the days in a year that was not yet
come, St Colum landed in his coracle, and gave
thanks on his bended knees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>When, warmed by the sun, they rose, they
found themselves in a waste place. Ill was
D&ugrave;ghall in his mind because of the portents,
and now to his fear and amaze the child
Bridget knelt on the stones, and, with claspt
hands, small and pink as the sea-shells round
about her, sang a song of words which were
unknown to him. This was the more marvellous,
as she was yet but an infant, and
could say no word even of Erse, the only
tongue she had heard.</p>
<p>At this portent, he knew that Aodh had
spoken seeingly. Truly this child was not of
human parentage. So he, too, kneeled, and,
bowing before her, asked if she were of the
race of the Tuatha de Danann, or of the older
gods, and what her will was, that he might be
her servant. Then it was that the kneeling
babe looked at him, and sang in a low sweet
voice in Erse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I am but a little child,</p>
<p class="t0">D&ugrave;ghall, son of Hugh, son of Art,</p>
<p class="t0">But my garment shall be laid</p>
<p class="t0">On the lord of the world,</p>
<p class="t0">Yea, surely it shall be that He</p>
<p class="t0">The King of the Elements Himself</p>
<p class="t0">Shall lean against my bosom,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p class="t0">And I will give him peace,</p>
<p class="t0">And peace will I give to all who ask</p>
<p class="t0">Because of this mighty Prince,</p>
<p class="t0">And because of his Mother that is the Daughter of Peace.</p>
</div>
<p>And while D&ugrave;ghall Donn was still marvelling
at this thing, the Arch-Druid of Iona
approached, with his white-robed priests. A
grave welcome was given to the stranger.
While the youngest of the servants of God was
entrusted with the child, the Arch-Druid took
D&ugrave;ghall aside and questioned him. It was
not till the third day that the old man gave
his decision. D&ugrave;ghall Donn was to abide on
Iona if he so willed: but the child was to
stay. His life would be spared, nor would
he be a bondager of any kind, and a little
land to till would be given him, and all that
he might need. But of his past he was to say
no word. His name was to become as nought,
and he was to be known simply as D&ugrave;vach.
The child, too, was to be named Bride, for that
was the way the name Bridget was called in
the Erse of the Isles.</p>
<p>To the question of D&ugrave;ghall, that was thenceforth
D&ugrave;vach, as to why he laid so great stress
on the child that was a girl, and the reputed
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
offspring of shame at that, Cathal the Arch-Druid
replied thus: &ldquo;My kinsman Aodh of the
Golden Hair who sent you here, was wiser
than Hugh the King and all the Druids of
Aoimag. Truly, this child is an Immortal.
There is an ancient prophecy concerning her:
surely of her who is now here, and no other.
There shall be, it says, a spotless maid born of
a virgin of the ancient immemorial race in
Innisfail. And when for the seventh time the
sacred year has come, she will hold Eternity
in her lap as a white flower. Her maiden
breasts shall swell with milk for the Prince of
the World. She shall give suck to the King
of the Elements. So I say unto you, D&ugrave;vach,
go in peace. Take unto thyself a wife, and
live upon the place I will give thee on the
east side of Ioua. Treat Bride as though she
were thy spirit, but leave her much alone, and
let her learn of the sun and the wind. In the
fulness of time the prophecy shall be fulfilled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So was it, from that day of the days.
D&ugrave;vach took a wife unto himself, who weaned
the little Bride, who grew in beauty and grace,
so that all men marvelled. Year by year for
seven years the wife of D&ugrave;vach bore him a
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
son, and these grew apace in strength, so that
by the beginning of the third year of the
seventh cycle of Bride&rsquo;s life there were three
stalwart youths to brother her, and three comely
and strong lads, and one young boy fair to see.
Nor did anyone, not even Bride herself, saving
Cathal the Arch-Druid, know that D&ugrave;vach the
herdsman was D&ugrave;ghall Donn, of a princely
race in Innisfail.</p>
<p>In the end, too, D&ugrave;vach came to think that
he had dreamed, or at the least that Cathal
had not interpreted the prophecy aright. For
though Bride was of exceeding beauty, and of
a strange piety that made the young Druids
bow before her as though she were a b&agrave;ndia,
yet the world went on as before, and the days
brought no change. Often, while she was still
a child, he had questioned her about the
words she had said as a babe, but she had no
memory of them. Once, in her ninth year, he
came upon her on the hillside of Dun-I singing
these self-same words. Her eyes dreamed far
away. He bowed his head, and, praying to
the Giver of Light, hurried to Cathal. The
old man bade him speak no more to the child
concerning the mysteries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Bride lived the hours of her days upon the
slopes of Dun-I, herding the sheep, or in following
the kye upon the green hillocks and
grassy dunes of what then as now was called
the Machar. The beauty of the world was
her daily food. The spirit within her was like
sunlight behind a white flower. The birdeens
in the green bushes sang for joy when they saw
her blue eyes. The tender prayers that were
in her heart for all the beasts and birds, for
helpless children, and tired women, and for all
who were old, were often seen flying above her
head in the form of white doves of sunshine.</p>
<p>But when the middle of the year came that
was, though D&ugrave;vach had forgotten it, the year
of the prophecy, his eldest son, Conn, who was
now a man, murmured against the virginity of
Bride, because of her beauty and because a
chieftain of the mainland was eager to wed
her. &ldquo;I shall wed Bride or raid Ioua,&rdquo; was
the message he had sent.</p>
<p>So one day, before the great fire of the
summer-festival, Conn and his brothers reproached
Bride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idle are these pure eyes, O Bride, not to
be as lamps at thy marriage-bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, it is not by the eyes that we live,&rdquo;
replied the maiden gently, while to their fear
and amazement she passed her hand before her
face and let them see that the sockets were
empty.</p>
<p>Trembling with awe at this portent, D&ugrave;vach
intervened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Sun I swear it, O Bride, that thou
shalt marry whomsoever thou wilt and none
other, and when thou willest, or not at all if
such be thy will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when he had spoken, Bride smiled, and
passed her hand before her face again, and all
there were abashed because of the blue light
as of morning that was in her shining eyes.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The still weather had come, and all the isles
lay in beauty. Far south, beyond vision,
ranged the coasts of Eir&eacute;: westward, leagues
of quiet ocean dreamed into unsailed wastes
whose waves at last laved the shores of Tir-n&aacute;&rsquo;n-&Ograve;g,
the Land of Eternal Youth: northward,
the spell-bound waters sparkled in the
sunlight, broken here and there by purple
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
shadows, that were the isles of Staffa and
Ulva, Lunga and the isles of the columns,
misty Coll, and Tiree that is the land beneath
the wave; with, pale blue in the heat-haze, the
mountains of R&ucirc;m called Haleval, Haskeval,
and Oreval, and the sheer Scuir-na-Gillian and
the peaks of the Cuchullins in remote Skye.</p>
<p>All the sweet loveliness of a late spring
remained, to give a freshness to the glory of
summer. The birds had song to them still.</p>
<p>It was while the dew was yet wet on the
grass that Bride came out of her father&rsquo;s house,
and went up the steep slope of Dun-I. The
crying of the ewes and lambs at the pastures
came plaintively against the dawn. The lowing
of the kye arose from the sandy hollows
by the shore, or from the meadows on the
lower slopes. Through the whole island went
a rapid trickling sound, most sweet to hear:
the myriad voices of twittering birds, from the
dotterel in the sea-weed to the larks climbing
the blue spirals of heaven.</p>
<p>This was the morning of her birth, and she
was clad in white. About her waist was a
girdle of the sacred rowan, the feathery green
leaves of it flickering dusky shadows upon her
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
robe as she moved. The light upon her yellow
hair was as when morning wakes, laughing low
with joy amid the tall corn. As she went she
sang, soft as the crooning of a dove. If any
had been there to hear he would have been
abashed, for the words were not in Erse, and
the eyes of the beautiful girl were as those of
one in a vision.</p>
<p>When, at last, a brief while before sunrise,
she reached the summit of the Scuir, that is
so small a hill and yet seems so big in Iona
where it is the sole peak, she found three
young Druids there, ready to tend the sacred
fire the moment the sun-rays should kindle it.
Each was clad in a white robe, with fillets of
oak leaves; and each had a golden armlet.
They made a quiet obeisance as she approached.
One stepped forward, with a flush in his face
because of her beauty, that was as a sea-wave
for grace, and a flower for purity, and sunlight
for joy, and moonlight for peace, and the wind
for fragrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou mayst draw near if thou wilt, Bride,
daughter of D&ugrave;vach,&rdquo; he said, with something
of reverence as well as of grave courtesy in
his voice: &ldquo;for the holy Cathal hath said that
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
the Breath of the Source of All is upon thee.
It is not lawful for women to be here at this
moment, but thou hast the law shining upon
thy face and in thine eyes. Hast thou come
to pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at that moment a low cry came from
one of his companions. He turned, and rejoined
his fellows. Then all three sank upon
their knees, and with outstretched arms hailed
the rising of God.</p>
<p>As the sun rose, a solemn chant swelled
from their lips, ascending as incense through
the silent air. The glory of the new day came
soundlessly. Peace was in the blue heaven, on
the blue-green sea, on the green land. There
was no wind, even where the currents of the
deep moved in shadowy purple. The sea itself
was silent, making no more than a sighing
slumber-breath round the white sands of the
isle, or a hushed whisper where the tide lifted
the long weed that clung to the rocks.</p>
<p>In what strange, mysterious way, Bride did
not see; but as the three Druids held their
hands before the sacred fire there was a faint
crackling, then three thin spirals of blue smoke
rose, and soon dusky red and wan yellow
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
tongues of flame moved to and fro. The
sacrifice of God was made. Out of the immeasurable
heaven He had come, in His golden
chariot. Now, in the wonder and mystery of
His love, He was re-born upon the world,
re-born a little fugitive flame upon a low hill
in a remote isle. Great must be His love
that He could die thus daily in a thousand
places: so great His love that He could give
up His own body to daily death, and suffer
the holy flame that was in the embers He
illumined to be lighted and revered and then
scattered to the four quarters of the world.</p>
<p>Bride could bear no longer the mystery of
this great love. It moved her to an ecstasy.
What tenderness of divine love that could
thus redeem the world daily: what long-suffering
for all the evil and cruelty done
hourly upon the weeping earth: what patience
with the bitterness of the blind fates! The
beauty of the worship of Be&rsquo;al was upon her
as a golden glory. Her heart leaped to a song
that could not be sung. The inexhaustible
love and pity in her soul chanted a hymn that
was heard of no Druid or mortal anywhere,
but was known of the white spirits of Life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Bowing her head, so that the glad tears fell
warm as thunder-rain upon her hands, she
rose and moved away.</p>
<p>Not far from the summit of Dun-I is a
hidden pool, to this day called the Fountain
of Youth. Hitherward she went, as was her
wont when upon the hill at the break of day,
at noon, or at sundown. Close by the huge
boulder, which hides it from above, she heard
a pitiful bleating, and soon the healing of her
eyes was upon a lamb which had become
fixed in a crevice in the rock. On a crag
above it stood a falcon, with savage cries,
lusting for warm blood. With swift step
Bride drew near. There was no hurt to the
lambkin as she lifted it in her arms. Soft
and warm was it there, as a young babe
against the bosom that mothers it. Then
with quiet eyes she looked at the falcon, who
hooded his cruel gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no wrong in thee, Seobhag,&rdquo; she
said gently; &ldquo;but the law of blood shall not
prevail for ever. Let there be peace this
morn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when she had spoken this word, the
wild hawk of the hills flew down upon her
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
shoulder, nor did the heart of the lambkin
beat the quicker, while with drowsy eyes it
nestled as against its dam. When she stood
by the pool she laid the little woolly creature
among the fern. Already the bleating of it
was sweet against the forlorn heart of a ewe.
The falcon rose, circled above her head, and
with swift flight sped through the blue air.
For a time Bride watched its travelling
shadow: when it was itself no more than a
speck in the golden haze, she turned, and
stooped above the Fountain of Youth.</p>
<p>Beyond it stood then, though for ages past
there has been no sign of either, two quicken-trees.
Now they were gold-green in the morning
light, and the brown-green berries that had
not yet reddened were still small. Fair to see
was the flickering of the long finger-shadows
upon the granite rocks and boulders.</p>
<p>Often had Bride dreamed through their
foliage; but now she stared in amaze. She
had put her lips to the water, and had started
back because she had seen, beyond her own
image, that of a woman so beautiful that her
soul was troubled within her, and had cried
its inaudible cry, worshipping. When, trembling,
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
she had glanced again, there was none
beside herself. Yet what had happened? For,
as she stared at the quicken-trees, she saw
that their boughs had interlaced, and that they
now became a green arch. What was stranger
still was that the rowan-clusters hung in blood-red
masses, although the late heats were yet a
long way off.</p>
<p>Bride rose, her body quivering because of
the cool sweet draught of the Fountain of
Youth, so that almost she imagined the water
was for her that day what it could be once
in each year to every person who came to it,
a breath of new life and the strength and
joy of youth. With slow steps she advanced
towards the arch of the quickens. Her heart
beat as she saw that the branches at the
summit had formed themselves into the shape
of a wreath or crown, and that the scarlet
berries dropped therefrom a steady rain of red
drops as of blood. A sigh of joy breathed
from her lips when, deep among the red and
green, she saw the white merle of which the
ancient poets sang, and heard the exceeding
wonder of its rapture, which was now the
pain of joy and now the joy of pain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The song of the mystic bird grew wilder
and more sweet as she drew near. For a
brief while she hesitated. Then, as a white
dove drifted slow before her under and through
the quicken-boughs, a dove white as snow but
radiant with sunfire, she moved forward to
follow, with a dream-smile upon her face and
her eyes full of the sheen of wonder and
mystery, as shadowy waters flooded with
moonshine.</p>
<p>And this was the passing of Bride, who
was not seen again of D&ugrave;vach or her foster-brothers
for the space of a year and a day.
Only Cathal, the aged Arch-Druid, who died
seven days thence, had a vision of her, and
wept for joy.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>When the strain of the white merle ceased,
though it had seemed to her scarce longer
than the vanishing song of the swallow on
the wing, Bride saw that the evening was
come. Through the violet glooms of dusk
she moved soundlessly, save for the crispling
of her feet among the hot sands. Far as she
could see to right or left there were hollows
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
and ridges of sand; where, here and there,
trees or shrubs grew out of the parched soil,
they were strange to her. She had heard the
Druids speak of the sunlands in a remote,
nigh unreachable East, where there were trees
called palms, trees in a perpetual sunflood
yet that perished not, also tall dark cypresses,
black-green as the holy yew. These were
the trees she now saw. Did she dream, she
wondered? Far down in her mind was some
memory, some floating vision only, mayhap,
of a small green isle far among the
northern seas. Voices, words, faces, familiar
yet unfamiliar when she strove to bring them
near, haunted her.</p>
<p>The heat brooded upon the land. The sigh
of the parched earth was &ldquo;Water, water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she moved onward through the gloaming
she descried white walls beyond her: white
walls and square white buildings, looming
ghostly through the dark, yet home-sweet as
the bells of the cows on the sea-pastures, because
of the yellow lights every here and there
agleam.</p>
<p>A tall figure moved towards her, clad in
white, even as those figures which haunted her
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
unremembering memory. When he drew near
she gave a low cry of joy. The face of her
father was sweet to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will be the pitcher, Brighid?&rdquo; he
said, though the words were not the words
that were near her when she was alone. Nevertheless
she knew them, and the same manner
of words was upon her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pitcher, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, dreamer, when will you be taking heed!
It is leaving your pitcher you will be, and by
the Well of the Camels, no doubt: though little
matter will that be, since there is now no water,
and the drought is heavy upon the land. But
... Brighid....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure now, it is not safe for you to be on the
desert at night. Wild beasts come out of the
darkness, and there are robbers and wild men
who lurk in the shadow. Brighid ... Brighid
... is it dreaming you are still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was dreaming of a cool green isle in
northern seas, where....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you have never been, foolish lass,
and are never like to be. Sure, if any wayfarer
were to come upon us you would scarce
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
be able to tell him that yonder village is Bethlehem,
and that I am D&ugrave;ghall Donn the innkeeper,
D&ugrave;ghall, the son of Hugh, son of Art,
son of Conn. Well, well, I am growing old,
and they say that the old see wonders. But I
do not wish to see this wonder, that my daughter
Brighid forgets her own town, and the good inn
that is there, and the strong sweet ale that is
cool against the thirst of the weary. Sure, if
the day of my days is near it is near. &lsquo;Green
be the place of my rest,&rsquo; I cry, even as Ois&igrave;n
the son of Fionn of the hero-line of Trenmor
cried in his old age; though if Ois&igrave;n and the
Fi&agrave;nn were here not a green place would they
find now, for the land is burned dry as the
heather after a hill-fire. But now, Brighid, let
us go back into Bethlehem, for I have that for
the saying which must be said at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In silence the twain walked through the
gloaming that was already the mirk, till they
came to the white gate, where the asses and
camels breathed wearily in the sultry darkness,
with dry tongues moving round parched mouths.
Thence they fared through narrow streets, where
a few white-robed Hebrews and sons of the
desert moved silently, or sat in niches. Finally,
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
they came to a great yard, where more than a
score of camels lay huddled and growling in
their sleep. Beyond this was the inn, which
was known to all the patrons and friends of
D&ugrave;ghall Donn as the &ldquo;Rest and Be Thankful,&rdquo;
though formerly as the Rest of Clan-Ailpean,
for was he not himself through his mother
MacAlpine of the Isles, as well as blood-kin
to the great Cormac the Ard-Righ, to whom
his father, Hugh, was feudatory prince?</p>
<p>As D&ugrave;ghall and Bride walked along the
stone flags of a passage leading to the inner
rooms, he stopped and drew her attention to
the water-tanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look you, my lass,&rdquo; he said sorrowfully,
&ldquo;of these tanks and barrels nearly all are
empty. Soon there will be no water whatever,
which is an evil thing though I whisper
it in peace, to the Stones be it said. Now,
already the folk who come here murmur. No
man can drink ale all day long, and those
wayfarers who want to wash the dust of their
journey from their feet and hands complain
bitterly. And ... what is that you will be
saying? The kye? Ay, sure, there is the
kye; but the poor beasts are o&rsquo;ercome with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
heat, and there&rsquo;s not a Cailliach on the hills
who could win a drop more of milk from
them than we squeeze out of their udders
now, and that only with rune after rune till
all the throats of the milking lassies are as
dry as the salt grass by the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what I am saying is this: &rsquo;tis months
now since any rain will be falling, and every
crock of water has been for the treasuring as
though it had been the honey of Moy-Mell
itself. The moon has been full twice since
we had the good water brought from the
mountain-springs; and now they are for drying
up too. The seers say that the drought
will last. If that is a true word, and there
be no rain till the winter comes, there will be
no inn in Bethlehem called &lsquo;The Rest and
Be Thankful&rsquo;; for already there is not enough
good water to give peace even to your little
thirst, my birdeen. As for the ale, it is poor
drink now for man or maid, and as for the
camels and asses, poor beasts, they don&rsquo;t
understand the drinking of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, father; but what is to be
done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I will be telling you, my
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
lintie. Now, I have been told by an oganach
out of Jerusalem, that lives in another place
close by the great town, that there is a quenchless
well of pure water, cold as the sea with a
north wind in it, on a hill there called the
Mount of Olives. Now, it is to that hill I
will be going. I am for taking all the camels
and all the horses, and all the asses, and will
lade each with a burthen of water-skins, and
come back home again with water enough to
last us till the drought breaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all that was said that night. But
at the dawn the inn was busy, and all the
folk in Bethlehem were up to see the going
abroad of D&ugrave;ghall Donn and Ronald McIan,
his shepherd, and some Macleans and Maccallums
that were then in that place. It was
a fair sight to see as they went forth through
the white gate that is called the Gate of
Nazareth. A piper walked first, playing the
Gathering of the Swords: then came D&ugrave;ghall
Donn on a camel, and McIan on a horse, and
the herdsmen on asses, and then there were
the collies barking for joy.</p>
<p>Before he had gone, D&ugrave;ghall took Bride
out of the hearing of the others. There was
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
only a little stagnant water, he said; and as
for the ale, there was no more than a flagon
left of what was good. This flagon and the
one jar of pure water he left with her. On no
account was she to give a drop to any wayfarer,
no matter how urgent he might be; for
he, D&ugrave;ghall, could not say when he would
get back, and he did not want to find a dead
daughter to greet him on his return, let alone
there being no maid of the inn to attend to
customers. Over and above that, he made
her take an oath that she would give no one,
no, not even a stranger, accommodation at the
inn, during his absence.</p>
<p>Afternoon and night came, and dawn and
night again, and yet again. It was on the
afternoon of the third day, when even the
crickets were dying of thirst, that Bride heard
a clanging at the door of the inn.</p>
<p>When she went to the door she saw a
weary grey-haired man, dusty and tired. By
his side was an ass with drooping head, and
on the ass was a woman, young, and of a
beauty that was as the cool shadow of green
leaves and the cold ripple of running waters.
But beautiful as she was it was not this that
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
made Bride start: no, nor the heavy womb
that showed the woman was with child. For
she remembered her of a dream&mdash;it was a
dream, sure&mdash;when she had looked into a
pool on a mountain-side, and seen, beyond
her own image, just this fair and beautiful face,
the most beautiful that ever man saw since
Nais, of the Sons of Usna, beheld Deirdr&ecirc; in
the forest&mdash;ay, and lovelier far even than she,
the peerless among women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gu&rsquo;m beannaicheadh Dia an tigh,&rdquo; said the
grey-haired man in a weary voice, &ldquo;the blessing
of God on this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soraidh leat,&rdquo; replied Bride gently, &ldquo;and
upon you likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you give us food and drink, and,
after that, good rest at this inn? Sure it is
grateful we will be. This is my wife Mary,
upon whom is a mystery: and I am Joseph,
a carpenter in Arimathea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, and to you, too, Mary: and
peace. But there is neither food nor drink
here, and my father has bidden me give shelter
to none who comes here against his return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carpenter sighed, but the fair woman
on the ass turned her shadowy eyes upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
Bride, so that the maiden trembled with joy
and fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it forgetting me you will be,
Brighid-Alona,&rdquo; she murmured, in the good
sweet Gaelic of the Isles; and the voice of
her was like the rustle of leaves when a soft
rain is falling in a wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I remember,&rdquo; Bride whispered, filled
with deep awe. Then without a word she
turned, and beckoned them to follow: which,
having left the ass by the doorway, they
did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is all the ale that I have,&rdquo; she said,
as she gave the flagon to Joseph: &ldquo;and here,
Mary, is all the water that there is. Little
there is, but it is you that are welcome to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, when they had quenched their thirst
she brought out oatcakes and scones and
brown bread, and would fain have added milk,
but there was none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the byre, Brighid,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;and
the first of the kye shall give milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Bride went, but returned saying that
the creature would not give milk without a
sian or song, and that her throat was too
dry to sing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say this sian,&rdquo; said Mary:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Give up thy milk to her who calls</p>
<p class="t0">Across the low green hills of Heaven</p>
<p class="t0">And stream-cool meads of Paradise!</p>
</div>
<p>And sure enough, when Bride did this, the
milk came: and she soothed her thirst, and
went back to her guests rejoicing. It was
sorrow to her not to let them stay where they
were, but she could not, because of her oath.</p>
<p>The man Joseph was weary, and said he
was too tired to seek far that night, and asked
if there was no empty byre or stable where
he and Mary could sleep till morning. At
that, Bride was glad: for she knew there was
a clean cool stable close to the byre where
her kye were: and thereto she led them, and
returned with peace at her heart.</p>
<p>When she was in the inn again, she was
afraid once more: for lo, though Mary and
Joseph had drunken deep of the jar and the
flagon, each was now full as it had been. Of
the food, too, none seemed to have been taken,
though she had herself seen them break the
scones and the oatcakes.</p>
<p>It was dusk when her reverie was broken
by the sound of the pipes. Soon thereafter
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
D&ugrave;ghall Donn and his following rode up to
the inn, and all were glad because of the cool
water, and the grapes, and the green fruits of
the earth, that they brought with them.</p>
<p>While her father was eating and drinking,
merry because of the ale that was still in
the flagon, Bride told him of the wayfarers.
Even as she spoke, he made a sign of silence,
because of a strange, unwonted sound that he
heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will that be meaning?&rdquo; he asked,
in a low, hushed voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is the rain at last, father. That is
a glad thing. The earth will be green again.
The beasts will not perish. Hark, I hear
the noise of it coming down from the hills as
well.&rdquo; But D&ugrave;ghall sat brooding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;is it not foretold
that the Prince of the World is to be born in
this land, during a heavy falling of rain, after
a long drought? And who is for knowing
that Bethlehem is not the place, and that this
is not the night of the day of the days?
Brighid, Brighid, the woman Mary must be
the mother of the Prince, who is to save all
mankind out of evil and pain and death!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>And with that he rose and beckoned to her
to follow. They took a lantern, and made
their way through the drowsing camels and
asses and horses, and past the byres where
the kye lowed gently, and so to the stable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure that is a bright light they are having,&rdquo;
D&ugrave;ghall muttered uneasily; for, truly, it
was as though the shed were a shell filled
with the fires of sunrise.</p>
<p>Lightly they pushed back the door. When
they saw what they saw they fell upon their
knees. Mary sat with her heavenly beauty
upon her like sunshine on a dusk land: in
her lap, a Babe, laughing sweet and low.</p>
<p>Never had they seen a Child so fair. He
was as though wrought of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; murmured D&ugrave;ghall Donn, of
Joseph, who stood near, with rapt eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Prince of Peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that Mary smiled, and the Child
slept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brighid, my sister dear&rdquo;&mdash;and, as she
whispered this, Mary held the little one to
Bride.</p>
<p>The fair girl took the Babe in her arms,
and covered it with her mantle. Therefore it
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
is that she is known to this day as Brighde-nam-Brat,
St Bride of the Mantle.</p>
<p>And all through that night, while the mother
slept, Bride nursed the Child with tender hands
and croodling crooning songs. And this was
one of the songs that she sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ah, Baby Christ, so dear to me,</p>
<p class="t">Sang Bridget Bride:</p>
<p class="t0">How sweet thou art,</p>
<p class="t0">My baby dear,</p>
<p class="t0">Heart of my heart!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Heavy her body was with thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Mary, beloved of One in Three,</p>
<p class="t">Sang Bridget Bride&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Mary, who bore thee, little lad:</p>
<p class="t0">But light her heart was, light and glad</p>
<p class="t0">With God&rsquo;s love clad.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sit on my knee,</p>
<p class="t">Sang Bridget Bride:</p>
<p class="t0">Sit here</p>
<p class="t0">O Baby dear,</p>
<p class="t0">Close to my heart, my heart:</p>
<p class="t0">For I thy foster-mother am,</p>
<p class="t0">My helpless lamb!</p>
<p class="t0">O have no fear,</p>
<p class="t">Sang good St Bride.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">None, none,</p>
<p class="t0">No fear have I:</p>
<p class="t0">So let me cling</p>
<p class="t0">Close to thy side</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p class="t0">Whilst thou dost sing,</p>
<p class="t0">O Bridget Bride!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My Lord, my Prince I sing:</p>
<p class="t0">My baby dear, my King!</p>
<p class="t">Sang Bridget Bride.</p>
</div>
<p>It was on this night that, far away in Iona,
the Arch-Druid Cathal died. But before the
breath went from him he had his vision of joy,
and his last words were:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Brighde &rsquo;dol air a gl&ugrave;n,</p>
<p class="t0">Righ nan d&ugrave;l a shuidh &rsquo;na h-uchd!</p>
<p class="t0">(Bridget Bride upon her knee,</p>
<p class="t0">The King of the Elements asleep on her breast!)</p>
</div>
<p>At the coming of dawn Mary awoke, and
took the Child. She kissed Bride upon the
brows, and said this thing to her: &ldquo;Brighid,
my sister dear, thou shalt be known unto all
time as Muime Chriosd.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>No sooner had Mary spoken than Bride fell
into a deep sleep. So profound was this
slumber that when D&ugrave;ghall Donn came to see
to the wayfarers, and to tell them that the milk
and the porridge were ready for the breaking of
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
their fast, he could get no word of her at all.
She lay in the clean, yellow straw beneath
the manger, where Mary had laid the Child.
D&ugrave;ghall stared in amaze. There was no sign
of the mother, nor of the Babe that was the
Prince of Peace, nor of the douce, quiet man
that was Joseph the carpenter. As for Bride,
she not only slept so sound that no word of his
fell against her ears, but she gave him awe.
For as he looked at her he saw that she was
surrounded by a glowing light. Something in
his heart shaped itself into a prayer, and he
knelt beside her, sobbing low. When he rose,
it was in peace. Mayhap an angel had comforted
his soul in its dark shadowy haunt of
his body.</p>
<p>It was late when Bride awoke, though she did
not open her eyes, but lay dreaming. For long
she thought she was in Tir-Tairngire, the Land
of Promise, or wandering on the honey-sweet
plain of Magh-Mell; for the wind of dreamland
brought exquisite odours to her, and in her ears
was a most marvellous sweet singing.</p>
<p>All round her there was a music of rejoicing.
Voices, lovelier than any she had ever heard,
resounded; glad voices full of praise and joy.
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
There was a pleasant tumult of harps and
trumpets, and as from across blue hills and
over calm water came the sound of the bagpipes.
She listened with tears. Loud and glad
were the pipes at times, full of triumph, as when
the heroes of old marched with Cuculain or
went down to battle with Fionn: again, they
were low and sweet, like humming of bees when
the heather is heavy with the honey-ooze. The
songs and wild music of the angels lulled her
into peace: for a time no thought of the woman
Mary came to her, nor of the Child that was
her foster-child.</p>
<p>Suddenly it was in her mind as though the
pipes played the chant that is called the
&ldquo;Aoibhneas a Shlighe,&rdquo; &ldquo;the joy of his way,&rdquo;
a march played before a bridegroom going to
his bride.</p>
<p>Out of this glad music came a solitary voice,
like a child singing on the hillside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way of wonder shall be thine, O Brighid-Naomha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was what the child-voice sang. Then
it was as though all the harpers of the west
were playing &ldquo;air cl&agrave;rsach&rdquo;: and the song of
a multitude of voices was this:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed art thou, O Brighid, who nursed the
King of the Elements in thy bosom: blessed
thou, the Virgin Sister of the Virgin Mother,
for unto all time thou shalt be called Muime
Chriosd, the Foster-Mother of Jesus that is the
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, Bride remembered all, and opened
her eyes. Nought strange was there to see,
save that she lay in the stable. Then as she
noted that the gloaming had come, she wondered
at the soft light that prevailed in the
shed, though no lamp or candle burned there.
In her ears, too, still lingered a wild and
beautiful music.</p>
<p>It was strange. Was it all a dream, she
pondered. But even as she thought thus, she
saw half of her mantle lying upon the straw
in the manger. Much she marvelled at this,
but when she took the garment in her hand
she wondered more. For though it was no
more than a half of the poor mantle wherewith
she had wrapped the Babe, it was all
wrought with mystic gold lines and with precious
stones more glorious than ever Arch-Druid
or Island Prince had seen. The marvel
gave her awe at last, when, as she placed the
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
garment upon her shoulder, it covered her
completely.</p>
<p>She knew now that she had not dreamed,
and that a miracle was done. So with gladness
she went out of the stable, and into the
inn. D&ugrave;ghall Donn was amazed when he saw
her, and then rejoiced exceedingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so merry, my father,&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is glad that I am. For now the folk
will be laughing the wrong way. This very
morning I was so pleased with the pleasure,
that while the pot was boiling on the peats I
went out and told every one I met that the
Prince of Peace was come, and had just been
born in the stable behind the &lsquo;Rest and Be
Thankful.&rsquo; Well, that saying was just like a
weasel among the rabbits, only it was an old
toothless weasel: for all Bethlehem mocked me,
some with jeers, some with hard words, and
some with threats. Sure, I cursed them right
and left. No, not for all my cursing&mdash;and by
the blood of my fathers, I spared no man
among them, wishing them sword and fire,
the black plague and the grey death&mdash;would
they believe. So back it was that I came, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
going through the inn I am come to the stable.
&lsquo;Sorrow is on me like a grey mist,&rsquo; said Ois&igrave;n,
mourning for Oscur, and sure it was a grey
mist that was on me when not a sign of man,
woman, or child was to be seen, and you so
sound asleep that a March gale in the Moyle
wouldn&rsquo;t have roused you. Well, I went back,
and told this thing, and all the people in
Bethlehem mocked at me. And the Elders
of the People came at last, and put a fine
upon me: and condemned me to pay three
barrels of good ale, and a sack of meal, and
three thin chains of gold, each three yards
long: and this for causing a false rumour,
and still more for making a laughing-stock of
the good folk of Bethlehem. There was a man
called Murdoch-Dhu, who is the chief smith
in Nazareth, and it&rsquo;s him I&rsquo;m thinking will
have laughed the Elders into doing this hard
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then that Bride was aware of a marvel
upon her, for she blew an incantation off the
palm of her hand, and by that frith she
knew where the dues were to be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By what I see in the air that is blown off
the palm of my hand, father, I bid you go
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
into the cellar of the inn. There you will
find three barrels full of good ale, and beside
them a sack of meal, and the sack is tied with
three chains of gold, each three yards long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But while D&ugrave;ghall Donn went away rejoicing,
and found that which Bride had foretold,
she passed out into the street. None saw her
in the gloaming, or as she went towards the
Gate of the East. When she passed by the
Lazar-house she took her mantle off her back
and laid it in the place of offerings. All the
jewels and fine gold passed into invisible birds
with healing wings: and these birds flew about
the heads of the sick all night, so that at dawn
every one arose, with no ill upon him, and went
on his way rejoicing. As each went out of
Bethlehem that morning of the mornings he
found a clean white robe and new sandals at
the first mile; and, at the second, food and cool
water; and, at the third, a gold piece and a
staff.</p>
<p>The guard that was at the Eastern Gate did
not hail Bride. All the gaze of him was upon
a company of strange men, shepherd-kings,
who said they had come out of the East led
by a star. They carried rare gifts with them
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
when they first came to Bethlehem: but no
man knew whence they came, what they
wanted, or whither they went.</p>
<p>For a time Bride walked along the road that
leads to Nazareth. There was fear in her gentle
heart when she heard the howling of hyenas
down in the dark hollows, and she was glad
when the moon came out and shone quietly
upon her.</p>
<p>In the moonlight she saw that there were
steps in the dew before her. She could see
the black print of feet in the silver sheen on
the wet grass, for it was on a grassy hill that
she now walked, though a day ago every leaf
and sheath there had lain brown and withered.
The footprints she followed were those of a
woman and of a child.</p>
<p>All night through she tracked those wandering
feet in the dew. They were always fresh
before her, and led her away from the villages,
and also where no wild beasts prowled through
the gloom. There was no weariness upon her,
though often she wondered when she should
see the fair wondrous face she sought. Behind
her also were footsteps in the dew, though she
knew nothing of them. They were those of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
Following Love. And this was the Lorgadh-Brighde
of which men speak to this day: the
Quest of the holy St Bride.</p>
<p>All night she walked; now upon the high
slopes of a hill. Never once did she have a
glimpse of any figure in the moonlight, though
the steps in the dew before her were newly
made, and none lay in the glisten a short way
ahead.</p>
<p>Suddenly she stopped. There were no more
footprints. Eagerly she looked before her.
On a hill beyond the valley beneath her she
saw the gleaming of yellow stars. These were
the lights of a city. &ldquo;Behold, it is Jerusalem,&rdquo;
she murmured, awe-struck, for she had never
seen the great town.</p>
<p>Sweet was the breath of the wind that stirred
among the olives on the mount where she
stood. It had the smell of heather, and she
could hear the rustle of it among the bracken
on a hill close by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, this must be the Mount of Olives,&rdquo;
she whispered, &ldquo;The Mount of which I have
heard my father speak, and that must be the
hill called Calvary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even as she gazed marvelling, she sighed
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
with new wonder; for now she saw that the
yellow stars were as the twinkling of the fires
of the sun along the crest of a hill that is set
in the east. There was a living joy in the
dawntide. In her ears was a sweet sound of
the bleating of ewes and lambs. From the
hollows in the shadows came the swift singing
rush of the flowing tide. Faint cries of the
herring gulls filled the air; from the weedy
boulders by the sea the skuas called wailingly.</p>
<p>Bewildered, she stood intent. If only she
could see the footprints again, she thought.
Whither should she turn, whither go? At
her feet was a yellow flower. She stooped
and plucked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, O little sun-flower, which way
shall I be going?&rdquo; and as she spoke a small
golden bee flew up from the heart of it, and up
the hill to the left of her. So it is that from
that day the dandelion is called am-B&egrave;arn&agrave;n-Bhrighde.</p>
<p>Still she hesitated. Then a sea-bird flew by
her with a loud whistling cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, O eisire&ugrave;n,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;which
way shall I be going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at this the eisire&ugrave;n swerved in its flight,
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
and followed the golden bee, crying, &ldquo;This
way, O Bride, Bride, Bride, Bride, Bri-i-i-ide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it is that from that day the oyster-catcher
has been called the Gille-Bhrighde,
the Servant of St Bridget.</p>
<p>Then it was that Bride said this sian:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Dia romham;</p>
<p class="t0">Moire am dheaghuidh;</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;S am Mac a thug Righ nan Dul!</p>
<p class="t0">Mis&rsquo; air do shlios, a Dhia,</p>
<p class="t0">Is Dia ma&rsquo;m luirg.</p>
<p class="t0">Mac&rsquo; &rsquo;oire, a&rsquo;s Righ nan Dul,</p>
<p class="t0">A shoillseachadh gach ni dheth so,</p>
<p class="t0">Le a ghras, mu&rsquo;m choinneamh.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">God before me;</p>
<p class="t0">The Virgin Mary after me;</p>
<p class="t0">And the Son sent by the King of the Elements.</p>
<p class="t0">I am to windward of thee, O God!</p>
<p class="t0">And God on my footsteps.</p>
<p class="t0">May the Son of Mary, King of the Elements,</p>
<p class="t0">Reveal the meaning of each of these things</p>
<p class="t0">Before me, through His grace.</p>
</div>
<p>And as she ended she saw before her two
quicken-trees, of which the boughs were interwrought
so that they made an arch. Deep
in the green foliage was a white merle that
sang a wondrous sweet song. Above it the
small branches were twisted into the shape of
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
a wreath or crown, lovely with the sunlit rowan-clusters,
from whose scarlet berries red drops
as of blood fell.</p>
<p>Before her flew a white dove, all aglow as
with golden light. She followed, and passed
beneath the quicken arch.</p>
<p>Sweet was the song of the merle, that was
then no more; sweet the green shadow of the
rowans, that now grew straight as young pines.
Sweet the far song in the sky, where the white
dove flew against the sun.</p>
<p>Bride looked, and her eyes were glad.
Bonnie the blooming of the heather on the
slopes of Dun-I. Iona lay green and gold,
isled in her blue waters. From the sheiling
of D&ugrave;vach, her father, rose a thin column of
pale blue smoke. The collies, seeing her,
barked loudly with welcoming joy.</p>
<p>The bleating of the sheep, the lowing of
the kye, the breath of the salt wind from the
open sea beyond, the song of the flowing tide
in the Sound beneath: dear the homing.</p>
<p>With a strange light in her eyes she moved
down through the heather and among the
green bracken: white, wonderful, fair to see.</p>

<h2><span class="h2line1">THE THREE MARVELS OF IONA</span></h2>
<h3><a id="cc1">I</a>
<br />THE FESTIVAL OF THE BIRDS</h3>
<p>Before dawn, on the morning of the hundredth
Sabbath after Colum the White had made glory
to God in Hy, that was theretofore called Ioua
and thereafter I-shona and is now Iona, the
Saint beheld his own Sleep in a vision.</p>
<p>Much fasting and long pondering over the
missals, with their golden and azure and sea-green
initials and earth-brown branching letters,
had made Colum weary. He had brooded
much of late upon the mystery of the living
world that was not man&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>On the eve of that hundredth Sabbath, which
was to be a holy festival in Iona, he had talked
long with an ancient greybeard out of a remote
isle in the north, the wild Isle of the Mountains,
where Scathach the Queen hanged the men of
Lochlin by their yellow hair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>This man&rsquo;s name was Ardan, and he was of
the ancient people. He had come to Hy because
of two things. Maolm&ograve;r, the King of
the northern Picts, had sent him to learn of
Colum what was this god-teaching he had
brought out of Eir&eacute;: and for himself he had
come, with his age upon him, to see what
manner of man this Colum was, who had
made Ioua, that was &ldquo;Innis-nan-Dhruidhneach&rdquo;&mdash;the
Isle of the Druids&mdash;into a place of new
worship.</p>
<p>For three hours Ardan and Colum had
walked by the sea-shore. Each learned of the
other. Ardan bowed his head before the
wisdom. Colum knew in his heart that the
Druid saw mysteries.</p>
<p>In the first hour they talked of God. Colum
spake, and Ardan smiled in his shadowy eyes.
&ldquo;It is for the knowing,&rdquo; he said, when Colum
ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, sure,&rdquo; said the Saint: &ldquo;and now, O
Ardan the wise, is my God thy God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at that Ardan smiled not. He turned
the grave, sad eyes of him to the west. With
his right hand he pointed to the Sun that
was like a great golden flower. &ldquo;Truly, He
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
is thy God and my God.&rdquo; Colum was silent.
Then he said: &ldquo;Thee and thine, O Ardan,
from Maolm&ograve;r the Pictish king to the least
of thy slaves, shall have a long weariness in
Hell. That fiery globe yonder is but the
Lamp of the World: and sad is the case of
the man who knows not the torch from the
torch-bearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the second hour they talked of Man.
Ardan spake, and Colum smiled in his deep,
grey eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for laughter that,&rdquo; he said, when Ardan
ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why will that be, O Colum of Eir&eacute;?&rdquo;
said Ardan. Then the smile went out of Colum&rsquo;s
grey eyes, and he turned and looked about him.</p>
<p>He beheld, near, a crow, a horse, and a hound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are thy brethren,&rdquo; he said scornfully.</p>
<p>But Ardan answered quietly, &ldquo;Even so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third hour they talked about the beasts
of the earth and the fowls of the air.</p>
<p>At the last Ardan said: &ldquo;The ancient wisdom
hath it that these are the souls of men
and women that have been, or are to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereat Colum answered: &ldquo;The new wisdom,
that is old as eternity, declareth that God created
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
all things in love. Therefore are we at one,
O Ardan, though we sail to the Isle of Truth
from the West and the East. Let there be
peace between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; said Ardan.</p>
<p>That eve, Ardan of the Picts sat with the
monks of Iona. Colum blessed him and said
a saying. Oran of the Songs sang a hymn of
beauty. Ardan rose, and put the wine of
guests to his lips, and chanted this rune:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Colum and monks of Christ,</p>
<p class="t0">It is peace we are having this night:</p>
<p class="t0">Sure, peace is a good thing,</p>
<p class="t0">And I am glad with the gladness.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We worship one God,</p>
<p class="t0">Though ye call him D&egrave;&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">And I say not, <i>O Dia</i>!</p>
<p class="t0">But cry <i>Bea&rsquo;uil</i>!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For it is one faith for man,</p>
<p class="t0">And one for the living world,</p>
<p class="t0">And no man is wiser than another&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">And none knoweth much.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">None knoweth a better thing than this:</p>
<p class="t0">The Sword, Love, Song, Honour, Sleep.</p>
<p class="t0">None knoweth a surer thing than this:</p>
<p class="t0">Birth, Sorrow, Pain, Weariness, Death.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sure, peace is a good thing;</p>
<p class="t0">Let us be glad of Peace:</p>
<p class="t0">We are not men of the Sword,</p>
<p class="t0">But of the Rune and the Wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I have learned a truth of Colum,</p>
<p class="t0">He hath learned of me:</p>
<p class="t0">All ye on the morrow shall see</p>
<p class="t0">A wonder of the wonders.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The thought is on you, that the Cross</p>
<p class="t0">Is known only of you:</p>
<p class="t0">Lo, I tell you the birds know it</p>
<p class="t0">That are marked with the Sorrow.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Listen to the Birds of Sorrow,</p>
<p class="t0">They shall tell you a great Joy:</p>
<p class="t0">It is Peace you will be having,</p>
<p class="t0">With the Birds.</p>
</div>
<p>No more would Ardan say after that, though
all besought him.</p>
<p>Many pondered long that night. Oran made
a song of mystery. Colum brooded through the
dark; but before dawn he slept upon the fern
that strewed his cell. At dawn, with waking
eyes, and weary, he saw his Sleep in a vision.</p>
<p>It stood grey and wan beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What art thou, O Spirit?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thy Sleep, Colum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it peace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wouldest thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have wisdom. Thy heart and thy brain
were closed. I could not give you what I
brought. I brought wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Colum, sitting upon the strewed fern
that was his bed, rubbed his eyes that were
heavy with weariness and fasting and long
prayer. He could not see his Sleep now.
It was gone as smoke that is licked up by
the wind.</p>
<p>But on the ledge of the hole that was in
the eastern wall of his cell he saw a bird.
He leaned his elbow upon the leabhar-aifrionn
that was by his side.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
Then he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there song upon thee, O Bru-dhearg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Red-breast sang, and the singing
was so sweet that tears came into the eyes
of Colum, and he thought the sunlight that
was streaming from the east was melted into
that lilting sweet song. It was a hymn that
the Bru-dhearg sang, and it was this:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy, Holy, Holy,</p>
<p class="t">Christ upon the Cross:</p>
<p class="t0">My little nest was near,</p>
<p class="t">Hidden in the moss.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy, Holy, Holy,</p>
<p class="t">Christ was pale and wan:</p>
<p class="t0">His eyes beheld me singing</p>
<p class="t"><i>Bron, Bron, mo Bron!</i><a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy, Holy, Holy,</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Come near, O wee brown bird!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Christ spake: and lo, I lighted</p>
<p class="t">Upon the Living Word.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy, Holy, Holy,</p>
<p class="t">I heard the mocking scorn!</p>
<p class="t0">But <i>Holy</i>, <i>Holy</i>, <i>Holy</i></p>
<p class="t">I sang against a thorn!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy, Holy, Holy,</p>
<p class="t">Ah, his brow was bloody:</p>
<p class="t0">Holy, Holy, Holy,</p>
<p class="t">All my breast was ruddy.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy, Holy, Holy,</p>
<p class="t">Christ&rsquo;s-Bird shalt thou be:</p>
<p class="t0">Thus said Mary Virgin</p>
<p class="t">There on Calvary.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy, Holy, Holy,</p>
<p class="t">A wee brown bird am I:</p>
<p class="t0">But my breast is ruddy</p>
<p class="t">For I saw Christ die.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy, Holy, Holy,</p>
<p class="t">By this ruddy feather,</p>
<p class="t0">Colum, call thy monks, and</p>
<p class="t">All the birds together.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>And at that Colum rose. Awe was upon
him, and joy.</p>
<p>He went out and told all to the monks.
Then he said Mass out on the green sward.
The yellow sunshine was warm upon his grey
hair. The love of God was warm in his
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, all ye birds!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>And lo, all the birds of the air flew nigh.
The golden eagle soared from the Cuchullins
in far-off Skye, and the osprey from the
wild lochs of Mull; the gannet from above
the clouds, and the fulmar and petrel from
the green wave: the cormorant and the skua
from the weedy rock, and the plover and
the kestrel from the machar: the corbie and
the raven from the moor, and the snipe
and the bittern and the heron: the cuckoo
and cushat from the woodland: the crane
from the swamp, the lark from the sky, and
the mavis and the merle from the green
bushes: the yellowyite, the shilfa, and the
lintie, the gyalvonn and the wren and the
redbreast, one and all, every creature of the
wings, they came at the bidding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; cried Colum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; cried all the Birds, and even the
Eagle, the Kestrel, the Corbie, and the Raven
cried <i>Peace</i>, <i>Peace</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will say the Mass,&rdquo; said Colum the
White.</p>
<p>And with that he said the Mass. And he
blessed the birds.</p>
<p>When the last chant was sung, only the
Bru-dhearg remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, O Ruddy-Breast,&rdquo; said Colum, &ldquo;and
sing to us of the Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through a golden hour thereafter the Red-breast
sang. Sweet was the joy of it.</p>
<p>At the end Colum said, &ldquo;Peace! In the
name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereat Ardan the Pict bowed his head,
and in a loud voice repeated&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&igrave;th</i> (shee)! <i>An ainm an Athar, &rsquo;s an mhic,
&rsquo;s an Spioraid Naoimh!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to this day the song of the Birds of
Colum, as they are called in Hy, is <i>S&igrave;th&mdash;S&igrave;th&mdash;S&igrave;th&mdash;an&mdash;ainm&mdash;Chriosd</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace&mdash;Peace&mdash;Peace&mdash;in the name of
Christ!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h3><a id="cc2">II</a>
<br />THE SABBATH OF THE FISHES AND THE FLIES</h3>
<p>For three days Colum had fasted, save for a
mouthful of meal at dawn, a piece of rye-bread
at noon, and a mouthful of dulse and
spring-water at sundown. On the night of
the third day, Oran and Keir came to him
in his cell. Colum was on his knees, lost in
prayer. There was no sound there, save the
faint whispered muttering of his lips, and on
the plastered wall the weary buzzing of a fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master!&rdquo; said Oran in a low voice, soft
with pity and awe, &ldquo;Master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Colum took no notice. His lips still
moved, and the tangled hairs below his nether
lip shivered with his failing breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; said Keir, tender as a woman,
&ldquo;Father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colum did not turn his eyes from the
wall. The fly droned his drowsy hum upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
the rough plaster. It crawled wearily for a
space, then stopped. The slow hot drone filled
the cell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said Oran, &ldquo;it is the will of the
brethren that you break your fast. You are
old, and God has your glory. Give us peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; urged Keir, seeing that Colum
kneeled unnoticingly, his lips still moving
above his black beard, with the white hair
of him falling about his head like a snowdrift
slipping from a boulder. &ldquo;Father, be
pitiful! We hunger and thirst for your presence.
We can fast no longer, yet have we
no heart to break our fast if you are not with
us. Come, holy one, and be of our company,
and eat of the good broiled fish that awaiteth
us. We perish for the benediction of thine
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it was that Colum rose, and walked
slowly towards the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little black beast,&rdquo; he said to the fly that
droned its drowsy hum and moved not at all;
&ldquo;little black beast, sure it is well I am knowing
what you are. You are thinking you are
going to get my blessing, you that have come
out of hell for the soul of me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>At that the fly flew heavily from the wall,
and slowly circled round and round the head
of Colum the White.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What think you of that, brother Oran,
brother Keir?&rdquo; he asked in a low voice, hoarse
because of his long fast and the weariness
that was upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a fiend,&rdquo; said Oran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an angel,&rdquo; said Keir.</p>
<p>Thereupon the fly settled upon the wall
again, and again droned his drowsy hot hum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little black beast,&rdquo; said Colum, with the
frown coming down into his eyes, &ldquo;is it for
peace you are here, or for sin? Answer, I
conjure you in the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>An ainm an Athar, &rsquo;s an mhic, &rsquo;s an Spioraid
Naoimh</i>,&rdquo; repeated Oran below his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>An ainm an Athar, &rsquo;s an mhic, &rsquo;s an Spioraid
Naoimh</i>,&rdquo; repeated Keir below his breath.</p>
<p>Then the fly that was upon the wall flew
up to the roof and circled to and fro. And
it sang a beautiful song, and its song was this:</p>
<h4>I</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Praise be to God, and a blessing too at that, and a blessing!</p>
<p class="t0">For Colum the White, Colum the Dove, hath worshipped;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p class="t0">Yea, he hath worshipped and made of a desert a garden,</p>
<p class="t0">And out of the dung of men&rsquo;s souls hath made a sweet savour of burning.</p>
</div>
<h4>II</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A savour of burning, most sweet, a fire for the altar,</p>
<p class="t0">This he hath made in the desert; the hell-saved all gladden.</p>
<p class="t0">Sure he hath put his benison, too, on milch-cow and bullock,</p>
<p class="t0">On the fowls of the air, and the man-eyed seals, and the otter.</p>
</div>
<h4>III</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But where in his D&ucirc;n in the great blue mainland of Heaven</p>
<p class="t0">God the All-Father broodeth, where the harpers are harping his glory;</p>
<p class="t0">There where He sitteth, where a river of ale poureth ever,</p>
<p class="t0">His great sword broken, His spear in the dust, He broodeth.</p>
</div>
<h4>IV</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And this is the thought that moves in his brain, as a cloud filled with thunder</p>
<p class="t0">Moves through the vast hollow sky filled with the dust of the stars:</p>
<p class="t0"><i>What boots it the glory of Colum, since he maketh a Sabbath to bless me,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>And hath no thought of my sons in the deeps of the air and the sea?</i></p>
</div>
<p>And with that the fly passed from their
vision. In the cell was a most wondrous sweet
song, like the sound of far-off pipes over water.</p>
<p>Oran said in a low voice of awe, &ldquo;O our
God!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Keir whispered, white with fear, &ldquo;O God,
my God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Colum rose, and took a scourge from
where it hung on the wall. &ldquo;It shall be for
peace, Oran,&rdquo; he said, with a grim smile flitting
like a bird above the nest of his black beard;
&ldquo;it shall be for peace, Keir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that he laid the scourge heavily
upon the bent backs of Keir and Oran, nor
stayed his hand, nor let his three days&rsquo; fast
weaken the deep piety that was in the might
of his arm, and because of the glory to God.</p>
<p>Then, when he was weary, peace came into
his heart, and he sighed &ldquo;<i>Amen!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; said Oran the monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; said Keir the monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this thing hath been done,&rdquo; said Colum,
&ldquo;because of the evil wish of you and the
brethren, that I should break my fast, and eat of
fish, till God willeth it. And lo, I have learned
a mystery. Ye shall all witness to it on the
morrow, which is the Sabbath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night the monks wondered much. Only
Oran and Keir cursed the fishes in the deeps
of the sea and the flies in the deeps of the
air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>On the morrow, when the sun was yellow
on the brown sea-weed, and there was peace
on the isle and upon the waters, Colum and the
brotherhood went slowly towards the sea.</p>
<p>At the meadows that are close to the sea,
the Saint stood still. All bowed their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O winged things of the air,&rdquo; cried Colum,
&ldquo;draw near!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the air was full of the hum of
innumerous flies, midges, bees, wasps, moths,
and all winged insects. These settled upon
the monks, who moved not, but praised God
in silence. &ldquo;Glory and praise to God,&rdquo; cried
Colum, &ldquo;behold the Sabbath of the children
of God that inhabit the deeps of the air!
Blessing and peace be upon them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace! Peace!&rdquo; cried the monks, with one
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost!&rdquo; cried Colum the White,
glad because of the glory to God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>An ainm an Athar, &rsquo;s an mhic, &rsquo;s an Spioraid
Naoimh</i>,&rdquo; cried the monks, bowing reverently,
and Oran and Keir deepest of all, because
they saw the fly that was of Colum&rsquo;s cell leading
the whole host, as though it were their
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
captain, and singing to them a marvellous
sweet song.</p>
<p>Oran and Keir testified to this thing, and
all were full of awe and wonder, and Colum
praised God.</p>
<p>Then the Saints and the brotherhood moved
onward and went upon the rocks. When all
stood ankle-deep in the sea-weed that was
swaying in the tide, Colum cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O finny creatures of the deep, draw near!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that the whole sea shimmered as
with silver and gold.</p>
<p>All the fishes of the sea, and the great
eels, and the lobsters and the crabs, came in
a swift and terrible procession. Great was
the glory.</p>
<p>Then Colum cried, &ldquo;O fishes of the Deep,
who is your king?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon the herring, the mackerel, and
the dog-fish swam forward, and each claimed
to be king. But the echo that ran from wave
to wave said, <i>The Herring is King</i>.</p>
<p>Then Colum said to the mackerel: &ldquo;Sing
the song that is upon you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the mackerel sang the song of the wild
rovers of the sea, and the lust of pleasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Then Colum said, &ldquo;But for God&rsquo;s mercy,
I would curse you, O false fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he spake likewise to the dog-fish:
and the dog-fish sang of slaughter and the
chase, and the joy of blood.</p>
<p>And Colum said: &ldquo;Hell shall be your
portion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there was peace. And the Herring
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereat all that mighty multitude, ere they
sank into the deep, waved their fins and their
claws, each after his kind, and repeated as
with one voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>An ainm an Athar, &rsquo;s an mhic, &rsquo;s an Spioraid
Naoimh!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the glory that was upon the Sound of
Iona was as though God trailed a starry net
upon the waters, with a shining star in every
little hollow, and a flowing moon of gold on
every wave.</p>
<p>Then Colum the White put out both his
arms, and blessed the children of God that
are in the deeps of the sea and that are in
the deeps of the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>That is how Sabbath came upon all living
things upon Hy that is called Iona, and within
the air above Hy, and within the sea that is
around Hy.</p>
<p>And the glory is Colum&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h3><a id="cc3">III</a>
<br />THE MOON-CHILD</h3>
<p>A year and a day before God bade Colum
arise to the Feast of Eternity, P&ograve;l the
Freckled, the youngest of the brethren, came
to him, on a night of the nights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moon is among the stars, O Colum.
By his own will, and yours, old Murtagh that
is this day with God, is to be laid in the deep
dry sand at the east end of the isle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the holy Saint rose from his bed of
weariness, and went and blessed the place
that Murtagh lay in, and bade neither the
creeping worm nor any other creature to touch
the sacred dead. &ldquo;Let God only,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;let God alone strip that which he made to
grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But on his way back sleep passed from him.
The sweet salt smell of the sea was in his
nostrils: he heard the running of a wave in
all his blood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>At the cells he turned, and bade the
brethren go in. &ldquo;Peace be with you,&rdquo; he
sighed wearily.</p>
<p>Then he moved downwards towards the
sea.</p>
<p>A great tenderness of late was upon Colum
the Bishop. Ever since he had blessed the
fishes and the flies, the least of the children
of God, his soul had glowed in a whiter flame.
There were deep seas of compassion in his
grey-blue eyes. One night he had waked,
because God was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Christ,&rdquo; he cried, bowing low his old
grey head. &ldquo;Sure, ah sure, the gladness and
the joy, because of the hour of the hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But God said: &ldquo;Not so, Colum, who keepest
me upon the Cross. It is Murtagh, Murtagh
the Druid that was, whose soul I am taking
to the glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that Colum rose in awe and great
grief. There was no light in his cell. In the
deep darkness, his spirit quailed. But lo, the
beauty of his heart wrought a soft gleam
about him, and in that moonshine of good
deeds he rose and made his way to where
Murtagh slept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The old monk slept indeed. It was a sweet
breath he drew&mdash;he, young and fair now, and
laughing with peace under the apples in
Paradise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Murtagh,&rdquo; Colum cried, &ldquo;and thee I
thought the least of the brethren, because
that thou wast a Druid, and loved not to see
thy pagan kindred put to the sword if they
would not repent. But, true, in my years
I am becoming as a boy who learns, knowing
nothing. God wash the sin of pride out of
my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that a soft white shining, as of one
winged and beautiful, stood beside the dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art thou Murtagh?&rdquo; whispered Colum, in
deep awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not Murtagh,&rdquo; came as the
breath of vanishing song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What art thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Peace,&rdquo; said the glory.</p>
<p>Thereupon Colum sank to his knees, sobbing
with joy, for the sorrow that had been and
was no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, O White Peace,&rdquo; he murmured,
&ldquo;can Murtagh hearken, there under the apples
where God is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s love is a wind that blows hitherward
and hence. Speak, and thou shalt hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colum spake. &ldquo;O Murtagh my brother, tell
me in what way it is that I still keep God
crucified upon the Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sound in the cell as of the
morning-laughter of children, of the singing of
birds, of the sunlight streaming through the
blue fields of Heaven.</p>
<p>Then Murtagh&rsquo;s voice came out of Paradise,
sweet with the sweetness: honey-sweet it was,
and clothed with deep awe because of the glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colum, servant of Christ, arise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colum rose, and was as a leaf there, a leaf
that is in the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colum, thine hour is not yet come. I see
it, bathing in the white light which is the Pool
of Eternal Life, that is in the abyss where
deep-rooted are the Gates of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my sin, O Murtagh, my sin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God is weary because thou hast not
repented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my God and my God! Sure, Murtagh, if
that is so, it is so, but it is not for knowledge
to me. Sure, O God, it is a blessing I have
put on man and woman, on beast and bird
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
and fish, on creeping things and flying things,
on the green grass and the brown earth and
the flowing wave, on the wind that cometh
and goeth, and on the mystery of the flame!
Sure, O God, I have sorrowed for all my sins:
there is not one I have not fasted and prayed
for. Sorrow upon me!&mdash;Is it accursed I am,
or what is the evil that holdeth me by the
hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Murtagh, calling through sweet dreams
and the rainbow-rain of happy tears that make
that place so wondrous and so fair, spake once
more:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Colum, blind art thou. Hast thou yet
repented because after that thou didst capture
the great black seal, that is a man under
spells, thou, with thy monks, didst crucify
him upon the great rock at the place where,
long ago, thy coracle came ashore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Murtagh, favoured of God, will you not
be explaining to Him that is King of the
Elements, that this was because the seal who
was called Black Angus wrought evil upon a
mortal woman, and that of the sea-seed was
sprung one who had no soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no answer came to that, and when
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
Colum looked about him, behold there was
no soft shining, but only the body of Murtagh
the old monk. With a heavy heart,
and his soul like a sinking boat in a sea
of pain, he turned and went out into the
night.</p>
<p>A fine, wonderful night it was. The moon
lay low above the sea, and all the flowing
gold and flashing silver of the rippling
running water seemed to be a flood going
that way and falling into the shining hollow
splendour.</p>
<p>Through the sea-weed the old Saint moved,
weary and sad. When he came to a sandy
place he stopped. There, on a rock, he saw a
little child. Naked she was, though clad with
soft white moonlight. In her hair were brown
weeds of the sea, gleaming golden because of
the glow. In her hands was a great shell,
and at that shell was her mouth. And she
was singing this song; passing sweet to
hear it was, with the sea-music that was in
it:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A little lonely child am I</p>
<p class="t">That have not any soul:</p>
<p class="t0">God made me but a homeless wave,</p>
<p class="t">Without a goal.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A seal my father was, a seal</p>
<p class="t">That once was man:</p>
<p class="t0">My mother loved him tho&rsquo; he was</p>
<p class="t">&rsquo;Neath mortal ban.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He took a wave and drown&egrave;d her,</p>
<p class="t">She took a wave and lifted him:</p>
<p class="t0">And I was born where shadows are</p>
<p class="t">I&rsquo; the sea-depths dim.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">All through the sunny blue-sweet hours</p>
<p class="t">I swim and glide in waters green;</p>
<p class="t0">Never by day the mournful shores</p>
<p class="t">By me are seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But when the gloom is on the wave</p>
<p class="t">A shell unto the shore I bring:</p>
<p class="t0">And then upon the rocks I sit</p>
<p class="t">And plaintive sing.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O what is this wild song I sing,</p>
<p class="t">With meanings strange and dim?</p>
<p class="t0">No soul am I, a wave am I,</p>
<p class="t">And sing the Moon-Child&rsquo;s hymn.</p>
</div>
<p>Softly Colum drew nigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Peace, little one. Ah
tender little heart, peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child looked at him with wide sea-dusky
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it Colum the Holy you will be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my fawn, my white dear babe: it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
not Colum the Holy I am, but Colum the
poor fool that knew not God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it you, O Colum, that put the sorrow
on my mother, who is the Sea-woman that
lives in the whirlpool over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, God forgive me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it you, O Colum, that crucified the seal
that was my father: him that was a man once,
and that was called Black Angus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, God forgive me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it you, O Colum, that bade the children
of Hy run away from me, because I was a
moon-child, and might win them by the sea-spell
into the green wave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, God forgive me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, dear Colum, it was to the glory of
God, it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, He knoweth it, and can hear it, too,
from Murtagh, who died this night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at that Colum looked, and in a moon-gold
wave he saw Black Angus, the seal-man,
drifting dark, and the eyes in his round head
were the eyes of love. And beside the man-seal
swam a woman fair to see, and she looked
at him with joy, and with joy at the Moon-Child
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
that was her own, and at Colum with
joy.</p>
<p>Thereupon Colum fell upon his knees and
cried&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me thy sorrow, wild woman of the
sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace to you, Colum,&rdquo; she answered, and
sank into the shadow-thridden wave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give my thy death and crucifixion, O
Angus-dhu!&rdquo; cried the Saint, shaking with
the sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace to you, Colum,&rdquo; answered the man-seal,
and sank into the dusky quietudes of
the deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, bitter heart o&rsquo; me! Teach me the way
to God, O little child,&rdquo; cried Colum the old,
turning to where the Moon-Child was!</p>
<p>But lo, the glory and the wonder!</p>
<p>It was a little naked child that looked at
him with healing eyes, but there were no sea-weeds
in her hair, and no shell in the little
wee hands of her. For now, it was a male
Child that was there, shining with a light
from within: and in his fair sunny hair was a
shadowy crown of thorns, and in his hand was
a pearl of great price.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;O Christ, my God,&rdquo; said Colum, with failing
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is thine now, O Colum,&rdquo; said the Moon-Child,
holding out to him the shining pearl
of great price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, O Lord my God?&rdquo; whispered
the old servant of God that was now glad with
the gladness: &ldquo;what is this, thy boon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect Peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><i>And that is all.</i>
<br />(<i>To God be the Glory. Amen.</i>)</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1"><i>THE MELANCHOLY OF ULAD</i></span></h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h2><span class="h2line1">THE MELANCHOLY OF ULAD</span></h2>
<p>In the sea-loch now known as that of Tarbert
of Loch Fyne, but in the old far-off days
named the Haven of the Foray, there was
once a grian&acirc;n, a sunbower, of so great a
beauty that thereto the strings of the singing
men&rsquo;s clarsachs vibrated even in far-away
Ireland.</p>
<p>This was in the days before the yellow-haired
men out of Lochlin came swarming in
their galleys, along the lochs and fjords of
the west. So long ago was it that none
knows if Ulad sang his song to Fand before
Diarmid the Fair was slain on the narrow
place between the two lochs, or if it were
when Colum&rsquo;s white-robes were wont to come
out of the open sea up the Loch of the
Swans, that is now West Loch Tarbert, so
as to reach the inlands.</p>
<p>But of what import is the whitherset of
bygone days, where the tale of the years and
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
of the generations is as that of autumn&rsquo;s
leaves?</p>
<p>Ulad was there, the poet-king: and Fand,
whom he loved: and Life and Death.</p>
<p>Ian M&ograve;r, of whom I have written, told me
the tale many years ago. I cannot recall all
he said, and I know well that the echo of
ancient music that was below his words, as
he spoke in the gloaming before the peats,
and in the ancient tongue of our people, is
not now what it was then.</p>
<p>None knows whence Ulad came. In the
Isles of the West men said he was a prince
out of the realm of the Ultonians; but there,
in the north of Eir&eacute;, they said he was a king
in the southlands. Art the White, the wise
old Ardrigh of the peoples who dwelt among
the lake-lands far south, spoke of Ulad as
one born under a solitary star on the night
of the Festival of Beltane, and told that he
came out of an ancient land north or south
of Muirnict, the sea which has the feet of
Wales and Cornwall upon its sunrise side and
the rocks and sands of Armorica upon that
where the light reddens the west. But upon
Ioua, that is now Iona, there was one wiser
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
even than Art the White, D&ugrave;ach the Druid:
and when questioned as to Ulad the poet-king,
he said he was of the ancient people
that dwelt among the inlands of Alba, the
old race that had known the divine folk, the
Tuatha-de-Danann, when they were seen of men
and no mortality was upon their sweet clay.
The islanders were awed by what D&ugrave;ach told
them, for what manner of man could this be
who had seen Merlin going tranced through
the woods, playing upon a reed, with wolves
fawning upon him, and the noise of eagles&rsquo;
wings ruffling the greenglooms of the forest
overhead?</p>
<p>And of Fand, who knows aught? B&ecirc;l
the Harper, whose songs and playing made
women&rsquo;s hearts melt like wax, and in men
wrought either intolerable longing or put sudden
swift flames into the blood, sang of her.
And what he sang was this: that Ulad had
fared once to Hy Br&agrave;sil and had there beheld
a garth of white blooms, fragrant and wonderful,
under the hither base of a rainbow. These
flowers he had gathered, and warmed all night
against his breast, and at dawn breathed into
them. When the sunbreak slid a rising line
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
along the dawn he blew a frith across the
palm of his left hand. What had been white
blooms, made rosy with his breath and warm
against his side, was a woman. It was
Fand.</p>
<p>Who, then, can tell whether Ulad were old
or young when he came to the Haven of the
Foray. He had the old ancient wisdom, and
mayhap knew how to wrap himself round with
the green life that endures.</p>
<p>None knew of his being in that place, till,
one set of a disastrous day, a birlinn drove in
before the tempest sweeping from the isle of
Arran up the great sea-loch of Fionn. The
oarsmen drew breath when the headlands were
past, and then stared with amaze. Overagainst
the bay in the little rocky promontory on the
north side was a house built wondrously, and
that where no house had stood, and after a
fashion that not one of them had seen, and
all marvelled with wide eyes. The sunset
flamed upon it, so that its shining walls were
glorious. A small round grian&acirc;n it was, but
built all of blocks and stones of hill-crystal,
and upborne upon four great pine-boles driven
deep into the tangled grass and sand, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
these hung about with deerskins and fells
of wolf and other savagery.</p>
<p>Before this grian&acirc;n the men in the birlinn,
upon whom silence had fallen, and whose listless
oars made no lapping upon the foam-white
small leaping waves of the haven, beheld a
man lying face downward.</p>
<p>For a time they thought the man was dead.
It was one, they said, some great one, who had
perished at the feet of his desire. Others
thought he was a king who had come there
to die alone, as Conn the Solitary had done,
when he had known all that man can know.
And some feared that the prone man was a
demon, and the shining grian&acirc;n a dreadful
place of spells. The howling of a wolf, in
the opposite glen that is called Strathnamara,
brought sweat upon their backs: for when the
half-human wish evil upon men they hide their
faces, and the howling of a she-wolf is heard.</p>
<p>But of a sudden the helmsman made a sign.
&ldquo;It is Ulad,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely, because
of the salt in his throat after that day of
flight and long weariness: &ldquo;It is Ulad the
Wonder-Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all there were glad, for each man knew
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
that Ulad the Wonder-Smith, that was a poet
and a king, wrought no ill against any clan,
and that wherever he was the swords slept.</p>
<p>Nevertheless they marvelled much that he
was there alone, and in that silence, with his
face prone upon the wilderness, while the
sunset flamed overagainst the grian&acirc;n that
was now like wine, or like springing blood
light and wonderful. But as tide and wind
brought the birlinn close upon the shore, they
heard a twofold noise, a rumour of strange
sound. One looked at the other, with amaze
that grew into fear. For the twofold sound
was wrought of the muffled sobs and prayers
of the man that lay upon the grass and of
the laughter of the woman that was unseen,
but who was within the grian&acirc;n.</p>
<p>Connla, the helmsman and leader of the seafarers,
waved to his fellows to pull the birlinn
close in among the weedy masses which hung
from the rocks. When the galley lay there,
all but hidden, and each man&rsquo;s head was beneath
the wrack, Connla rose. Slowly he
moved to where Ulad lay, face downward, upon
the silt of sand and broken rock that was in
front of the grian&acirc;n. But, before he could
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
speak, the young king rose, though not seeing
the newcomer, and, looking upon the sunbower,
whence the laughter suddenly ceased, raised
his arms.</p>
<p>Then, when he had raised his arms, song
was upon his lips. It was a strange chant that
Connla heard, and had the sound in it of the
wind far out at sea, or of a tempest moving
across treeless moors, mournful, wild, filled
with ancient sorrow and a crying that none
can interpret. And the words of it, familiar
to the helmsman, and yet with a strange lip-life
upon them, were as these:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Ah you in the grian&acirc;n there, whose laughter is on me as fire-flames,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>What of the sorrow of sorrows that is mine because of my loving&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>You that came to me out of the place where the rainbows are builded,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Is it woman you are, O Fand, who laughest up there in thy silence?</i></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Sure, I have loved thee through storm and peace, through the day and the night;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Sure, I have set the singing of songs to a marvellous swan-song for thee,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>And death I have dared, and life have I dared, and gloom and the grave,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>And yet, O Fand, thou laughest down on my pain, on my pain, O Fand.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>All things have I thrown away gladly only to win thee&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Kingship and lordship of men, the fame of the sword, and all good things&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>For in thee at the last, I dreamed, in thee, O Fand, Queen of Women,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>I had found all that a man may find, and was as the gods who die not.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>But what of all this to me, who am Ulad the King, the Harper,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Ulad the Singer of Songs that are fire in the hearts of the hearers,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Ulad the Wonder-Smith, who can bridle the winds and the billows,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Can lay waste the greatest of D&ucirc;ns or build grian&acirc;ns here in the wilds&mdash;</i></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>What of all this to me, who am only a man that seeketh,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>That seeketh for ever and ever the Soul that is fellow to his&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>The Soul that is thee, O Fand, who wert born of flowers &rsquo;neath the rainbow,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Breathed with my breath, warmed at my breast, O Fand, whom I love and I worship?</i></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>For all things are vain unto me, but one thing only, and that not vain is&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>My Dream, my Passion, my Hope, my Fand, whom I won from Hy Br&agrave;sil:</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>O Dream of my life, my Glory, O Rose of the World, my Dream,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Lo, death for Ulad the King, if thou failest, for all that I am of the Danann who die not.</i></p>
</div>
<p>And when he had chanted these words, Ulad,
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
who was young and wondrous fair to look upon,
held out his arms to Fand, whom yet he did
not see, for she was within the grian&acirc;n.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if even not yet at the setting of the
day,&rdquo; the king muttered, &ldquo;patience shall be
upon me till the coming of a new day, and
then it may be that Fand will hear my prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the night fell. But when the screaming
of the gulls came over the loch, and the
plaintive crying of the lapwings was upon the
moorland, and the smell of loneroid and bracken
was heavy in the wind-fallen stillness, Ulad
turned, for he felt a touch upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>It was Connla who touched him, and he knew
the man. He had the old wisdom of knowing
all that is in the mind by looking into the
eyes, and he knew how the man had come
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the men who are your men, O Connla,
move away from here in their birlinn, and go
farther up into the haven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And because he was a Wonder-Smith, and
knew all, the islander did as Ulad bade, and
without question. But when they were alone
again he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ulad, great lord, I am a man who is as
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
idle sand beneath the feet of you who know
the ancient wisdom, and are young with imperishing
years, and are a great king in some
land I know not of&mdash;so, at the least, men
say. But I know one thing that you do not
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will tell me one thing that I do
not know, O Connla, you shall have your
heart&rsquo;s desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Connla laughed at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even you, O Ulad, can give me my
heart&rsquo;s desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will that desire be then, you
whom the islesmen call Connla the Wise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one might see in the dew the footsteps
of old years returning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thing, Connla, I cannot do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet thou wouldst do what is a thing
as vain as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak. I will listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Connla drew close to Ulad, and
whispered in his ear. Thereafter he gave
him a hollow reed with holes in it, such as
the shepherding folk use on the hills. And
with that he went away into the darkness.</p>
<p>When the moon rose, Ulad took the reed
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
and played upon it. While he played, scales
fell from his eyes, and dreams passed from
his brain, and his heart grew light. Then
he sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Come forth, Fand, come forth, beautiful Fand, my woman, my fawn,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>The smell of thy falling hair is sweet as the breath of the wild-brier&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>I weary of this white moonshine who love better the white discs of thy breasts,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>And the secret song of the gods is faint beside the craving in my blood.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Fand, Fand, Fand, white one, who art no dream but a woman,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Come forth from the grian&acirc;n, or lo by the word of me, Ulad the King,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Forth shalt thou come as a she-wolf, and no more be a woman,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Come forth to me, Fand, who am now as a flame for thy burning!</i></p>
</div>
<p>Thereupon a low laugh was heard, and
Fand came forth out of the grian&acirc;n. White
and beautiful she was, the fairest of all
women, and Ulad was glad. When near,
she whispered in his ears, and hand-in-hand
they went back into the grian&acirc;n.</p>
<p>At dawn Ulad looked upon the beauty of
Fand, and he saw she was as a flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O fair and beautiful Dream,&rdquo; he whispered&mdash;but
of a sudden Fand laughed in her sleep,
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
and he remembered what Connla the Wise
had told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; Ulad muttered then, &ldquo;I see well
that thou art not my Dream, but only a
woman.&rdquo; And with that he half-rose from her.</p>
<p>Fand opened her eyes, and the beauty of
them was greater for the light that was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then thou art only Ulad, a man?&rdquo; she
cried, and she put her arms about him,
and kissed him on the lips and on the
breast, sobbing low as with a strange gladness&mdash;&ldquo;I
will follow thee, Ulad, to death, for
I am thy woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he said, looking beyond her, &ldquo;if I
feed thee, and call thee my woman, and find
pleasure in thee, and give thee my manhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what else wouldst thou, O Ulad?&rdquo;
Fand asked, wondering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Ulad the Lonely,&rdquo; he answered: this,
and no more.</p>
<p>Then, later, he took the hollow reed again,
and again played.</p>
<p>And when he had played he looked at Fand.
He saw into her heart, and into her brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have dreamed my dream,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
I am still Ulad the Wonder-Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>With that he blew a frith across the palm
of his left hand, and said this thing:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O woman that would not come to me,
when I called out of that within me which is
I myself, farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that Fand was a drift of white
flowers there upon the deerskins.</p>
<p>Then once more Ulad spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O woman, that heeded no bitter prayer
which I made, but at the last came only as
a she-wolf to the wolf, farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that a wind-eddy scattered the
white flowers upon the deerskins, and they
wavered hither and thither, and some were
stained by the pale wandering fires of a rainbow
that drifted over that place, then as now
the haunt of these cloudy splendours, forever
woven there out of sun and mist.</p>
<p>At noon, the seafarers came towards the
grian&acirc;n with songs, and offerings.</p>
<p>But Ulad was not there.</p>

<h2><span class="h2line1">ULA AND URLA</span></h2>
<p>Ula and Urla were under vow to meet by
the Stone of Sorrow. But Ula, dying first,
stumbled blindfold when he passed the
Shadowy Gate; and, till Urla&rsquo;s hour was
upon her, she remembered not.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p class="tb">These were the names that had been given
to them in the north isles, when the birlinn
that ran down the war-galley of the vikings
brought them before the Maormor.</p>
<p>No word had they spoken that day, and no
name. They were of the Gael, though Ula&rsquo;s
hair was yellow, and though his eyes were
blue as the heart of a wave. They would
ask nothing, for both were in love with death.
The Maormor of Siol Tormaid looked at
Urla, and his desire gnawed at his heart.
But he knew what was in her mind, because
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
he saw into it through her eyes, and he
feared the sudden slaying in the dark.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he brooded night and day
upon her beauty. Her skin was more white
than the foam of the moon: her eyes were
as a star-lit dewy dusk. When she moved,
he saw her like a doe in the fern: when she
stooped, it was as the fall of wind-swayed
water. In his eyes there was a shimmer as
of the sunflood in a calm sea. In that
dazzle he was led astray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he said to Ula, on a day of the
days. &ldquo;Go: the men of Siol Torquil will
take you to the south isles, and so you can
hale to your own place, be it Eir&egrave;ann or
Manannan, or wherever the south wind puts
its hand upon your home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was on that day Ula spoke for the first
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go, Coll mac Torcall; but I go not
alone. Urla that I love goes whither I go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is my spoil. But, man out of Eir&egrave;ann&mdash;for
so I know you to be, because of the
manner of your speech&mdash;tell me this: Of
what clan and what place are you, and
whence is Urla come; and by what shore
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
was it that the men of Lochlin whom we
slew took you and her out of the sea, as you
swam against the sun, with waving swords
upon the strand when the viking-boat carried
you away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How know you these things?&rdquo; asked Ula,
that had been Isla, son of the king of Islay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the sea-rovers spake before he
died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let the viking speak again. I have
nought to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the Maormor frowned, but said
no more. That eve Ula was seized, as he
walked in the dusk by the sea, singing low
to himself an ancient song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it death?&rdquo; he said, remembering another
day when he and Eilidh, that they
called Urla, had the same asking upon their
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ula frowned, but spake no word for a time.
Then he spake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me say one word with Urla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No word canst thou have. She, too, must
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ula laughed low at that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; he said. And they slew
him with a spear.</p>
<p>When they told Urla, she rose from the
deerskins and went down to the shore. She
said no word then. But she stooped, and she
put her lips upon his cold lips, and she
whispered in his unhearing ear.</p>
<p>That night Coll mac Torcall went secretly
to where Urla was. When he entered, a
groan came to his lips and there was froth
there: and that was because the spear that
had slain Ula was thrust betwixt his shoulders
by one who stood in the shadow. He
lay there till the dawn. When they found
Coll the Maormor he was like a seal speared
upon a rock, for he had his hands out, and
his head was between them, and his face was
downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat dust, slain wolf,&rdquo; was all that Eilidh,
whom they called Urla, said, ere she moved
away from that place in the darkness of the
night.</p>
<p>When the sun rose, Urla was in a glen
among the hills. A man who shepherded
there took her to his mate. They gave her
milk, and because of her beauty and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
frozen silence of her eyes, bade her stay with
them and be at peace.</p>
<p>They knew in time that she wished death.
But first, there was the birthing of the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Isla&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; she said to the woman.
Ula was but the shadow of a bird&rsquo;s wing:
an idle name. And she, too, was Eilidh
once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was death he gave you when he gave
you the child,&rdquo; said the woman once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was life,&rdquo; answered Eilidh, with her
eyes filled with the shadow of dream. And
yet another day the woman said to her that
it would be well to bear the child and let
it die: for beauty was like sunlight on a
day of clouds, and if she were to go forth
young and alone and so wondrous fair, she
would have love, and love is best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, love is best,&rdquo; Eilidh answered.
&ldquo;And because Isla loved me, I would that
another Isla came into the world and sang
his songs&mdash;the songs that were so sweet, and
the songs that he never sang, because I gave
him death when I gave him life. But now
he shall live again, and he and I shall be
in one body, in him that I carry now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>At that the woman understood, and said
no more. And so the days grew out of the
nights, and the dust of the feet of one month
was in the eyes of that which followed after;
and this until Eilidh&rsquo;s time was come.</p>
<p class="tb">Dusk after dusk, Ula that was Isla the
Singer, waited by the Stone of Sorrow. Then
a great weariness came upon him. He made
a song there, where he lay in the narrow
place; the last song that he made, for after
that he heard no trampling of the hours.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The swift years slip and slide adown the steep;</p>
<p class="t">The slow years pass; neither will come again.</p>
<p class="t0">Yon huddled years have weary eyes that weep,</p>
<p class="t">These laugh, these moan, these silent frown, these plain,</p>
<p class="t">These have their lips acurl with proud disdain.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O years with tears, and tears through weary years,</p>
<p class="t">How weary I who in your arms have lain:</p>
<p class="t0">Now, I am tired: the sound of slipping spears</p>
<p class="t">Moves soft, and tears fall in a bloody rain,</p>
<p class="t">And the chill footless years go over me who am slain.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I hear, as in a wood, dim with old light, the rain,</p>
<p class="t">Slow falling; old, old, weary, human tears:</p>
<p class="t0">And in the deepening dark my comfort is my Pain,</p>
<p class="t">Sole comfort left of all my hopes and fears,</p>
<p class="t">Pain that alone survives, gaunt hound of the shadowy years.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>But, at the last, after many days, he stirred.
There was a song in his ears.</p>
<p>He listened. It was like soft rain in a
wood in June. It was like the wind laughing
among the leaves.</p>
<p>Then his heart leaped. Sure, it was the
voice of Eilidh!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eilidh! Eilidh! Eilidh!</i>&rdquo; he cried. But
a great weariness came upon him again. He
fell asleep, knowing not the little hand that
was in his, and the small, flower-sweet body
that was warm against his side.</p>
<p>Then the child that was his looked into the
singer&rsquo;s heart, and saw there a mist of rainbows,
and midway in that mist was the face
of Eilidh, his mother.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the little one looked into his
brain that was so still, and he saw the music
that was there: and it was the voice of Eilidh
his mother.</p>
<p>And, again, the birdeen, that had the blue
of Isla&rsquo;s eyes and the dream of Eilidh&rsquo;s, looked
into Ula&rsquo;s sleeping soul: and he saw that it
was not Isla nor yet Eilidh, but that it was
like unto himself, who was made of Eilidh
and Isla.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>For a long time the child dreamed. Then
he put his ear to Isla&rsquo;s brow, and listened.
Ah, the sweet songs that he heard. Ah,
bitter-sweet moonseed of song! Into his life
they passed, echo after echo, strain after strain,
wild air after wild sweet air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isla shall never die,&rdquo; whispered the child,
&ldquo;for Eilidh loved him. And I am Isla and
Eilidh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the little one put his hands above
Isla&rsquo;s heart. There was a flame there, that
the Grave quenched not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O flame of love!&rdquo; sighed the child, and
he clasped it to his breast: and it was a
moonshine glory about the two hearts that
he had, the heart of Isla and the heart of
Eilidh, that were thenceforth one.</p>
<p>At dawn he was no longer there. Already
the sunrise was warm upon him where he
lay, new-born, upon the breast of Eilidh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the end,&rdquo; murmured Isla when he
waked. &ldquo;She has never come. For sure,
now, the darkness and the silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he remembered the words of Maol
the Druid, he that was a seer, and had told
him of Orchil, the dim goddess who is under
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
the brown earth, in a vast cavern, where she
weaves at two looms. With one hand she
weaves life upward through the grass; with
the other she weaves death downward through
the mould; and the sound of the weaving is
Eternity, and the name of it in the green
world is Time. And, through all, Orchil
weaves the weft of Eternal Beauty, that
passeth not, though its soul is Change.</p>
<p>And these were the words of Orchil, on
the lips of Maol the Druid, that was old, and
knew the mystery of the Grave.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>When thou journeyest towards the Shadowy
Gate take neither Fear with thee nor Hope, for
both are abashed hounds of silence in that place;
but take only the purple nightshade for sleep,
and a vial of tears and wine, tears that shall
be known unto thee and old wine of love. So
shalt thou have thy silent festival, ere the
end.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So therewith Isla, having, in his weariness,
the nightshade of sleep, and in his mind the
slow dripping rain of familiar tears, and deep
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
in his heart the old wine of love, bowed his
head.</p>
<p>It was well to have lived, since life was
Eilidh. It was well to cease to live, since
Eilidh came no more.</p>
<p>Then suddenly he raised his head. There
was music in the green world above. A
sunray opened the earth about him: staring
upward he beheld Angus Ogue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, fair face of the god of youth,&rdquo; he sighed.
Then he saw the white birds that fly about
the head of Angus Ogue, and he heard the
music that his breath made upon the harp of
the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arise,&rdquo; said Angus; and, when he smiled
the white birds flashed their wings and made
a mist of rainbows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arise,&rdquo; said Angus Ogue again, and, when
he spoke, the spires of the grass quivered to
a wild, sweet haunting air.</p>
<p>So Isla arose, and the sun shone upon him,
and his shadow passed into the earth. Orchil
wove it into her web of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why dost thou wait here by the Stone of
Sorrow, Isla that was called Ula at the
end?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wait for Eilidh, who cometh not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that the wind-listening god stooped and
laid his head upon the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear the coming of a woman&rsquo;s feet,&rdquo; he
said, and he rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eilidh! Eilidh!&rdquo; cried Isla, and the sorrow
of his cry was a moan in the web of
Orchil.</p>
<p>Angus Ogue took a branch, and put the
cool greenness against his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear the beating of a heart,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eilidh! Eilidh! Eilidh!&rdquo; Isla cried, and
the tears that were in his voice were turned
by Angus into dim dews of remembrance in
the babe-brain that was the brain of Isla and
Eilidh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear a word,&rdquo; said Angus Ogue, &ldquo;and
that word is a flame of joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isla listened. He heard a singing of birds.
Then, suddenly, a glory came into the shine
of the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I have come, Isla my king!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the voice of Eilidh. He bowed his
head, and swayed; for it was his own life
that came to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eilidh!</i>&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>And so, at the last, Isla came into his
kingdom.</p>
<p class="tb">But are they gone, these twain, who loved
with deathless love? Or is this a dream
that I have dreamed?</p>
<p>Afar in an island-sanctuary that I shall not
see again, where the wind chants the blind
oblivious rune of Time, I have heard the
grasses whisper: <i>Time never was, Time is
not</i>.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1"><i>THE DARK NAMELESS ONE</i></span></h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2><span class="h2line1">THE DARK NAMELESS ONE</span></h2>
<p>One day this summer I sailed with Padruic
Macrae and Ivor McLean, boatmen of Iona,
along the south-western reach of the Ross of
Mull.</p>
<p>The whole coast of the Ross is indescribably
wild and desolate. From Feenafort (Fhionnphort),
opposite Balliemore of Icolmkill, to the
hamlet of Earraid Lighthouse, it were hardly
exaggeration to say that the whole tract is
uninhabited by man and unenlivened by any
green thing. It is the haunt of the cormorant
and the seal.</p>
<p>No one who has not visited this region can
realise its barrenness. Its one beauty is the
faint bloom which lies upon it in the sunlight&mdash;a
bloom which becomes as the glow of an
inner flame when the sun westers without cloud
or mist. This is from the ruddy hue of the
granite, of which all that wilderness is wrought.</p>
<p>It is a land tortured by the sea, scourged by
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
the sea-wind. A myriad lochs, fiords, inlets,
passages, serrate its broken frontiers. Innumerable
islets and reefs, fanged like ravenous wolves,
sentinel every shallow, lurk in every strait. He
must be a skilled boatman who would take the
Sound of Earraid and penetrate the reaches of
the Ross.</p>
<p>There are many days in the months of peace,
as the islanders call the period from Easter till
the autumnal equinox, when Earraid and the
rest of Ross seem under a spell. It is the spell
of beauty. Then the yellow light of the sun
is upon the tumbled masses and precipitous
shelves and ledges, ruddy petals or leaves of
that vast Flower of Granite. Across it the
cloud shadows trail their purple elongations,
their scythe-sweep curves, and abrupt evanishing
floodings of warm dusk. From wet boulder
to boulder, from crag to shelly crag, from fissure
to fissure, the sea ceaselessly weaves a girdle
of foam. When the wide luminous stretch of
waters beyond&mdash;green near the land, and farther
out all of a living blue, interspersed with wide
alleys of amethyst&mdash;is white with the sea-horses,
there is such a laughter of surge and splash all
the way from Slugan-dubh to the Rudha-nam-Maol-M&ograve;ra,
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
or to the tide-swept promontory of
the Sgeireig-a&rsquo;-Bhochdaidh, that, looking inland,
one sees through a rainbow-shimmering veil of
ever-flying spray.</p>
<p>But the sun spell is even more fugitive upon
the face of this wild land than the spell of
beauty upon a woman. So runs one of our
proverbs: as the falling of the wave, as the
fading of the leaf, so is the beauty of a woman,
unless&mdash;ah, that <i>unless</i>, and the indiscoverable
fount of joy that can only be come upon by
hazard once in life, and thereafter only in
dreams, and the Land of the Rainbow that is
never reached, and the green sea-doors of
Tir-na-thonn, that open now no more to any
wandering wave!</p>
<p>It was from Ivor McLean, on that day, I
heard the strange tale of his kinsman Murdoch,
the tale of &ldquo;The Ninth Wave&rdquo; that I have told
elsewhere. It was Padruic, however, who told
me of the Sea-witch of Earraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have heard of the <i>each-uisge</i>
(the sea-beast, sea-kelpie, or water-horse),
but I have never seen it with the eyes. My
father and my brother knew of it. But this
thing I know, and this what we call <i>an-cailleach-uisge</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
(the siren or water-witch); the
<i>cailliach</i>, mind you, not the <i>maighdeann-mh&agrave;ra</i>
(the mermaid), who means no harm.
May she hear my saying it! The cailliach
is old and clad in weeds, but her voice is
young, and she always sits so that the light
is in the eyes of the beholder. She seems
to him young also, and fair. She has two
familiars in the form of seals, one black as
the grave, and the other white as the shroud
that is in the grave; and these sometimes
upset a boat, if the sailor laughs at the uisge-cailliach&rsquo;s
song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man netted one of those seals, more
than a hundred years ago, with his herring-trawl,
and dragged it into the boat; but the
other seal tore at the net so savagely, with its
head and paws over the bows, that it was
clear no net would long avail. The man
heard them crying and screaming, and then
talking low and muttering, like women in a
frenzy. In his fear he cast the nets adrift,
all but a small portion that was caught in
the thwarts. Afterwards, in this portion, he
found a tress of woman&rsquo;s hair. And that is
just so: to the Stones be it said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;The grandson of this man, T&ograve;mais McNair,
is still living, a shepherd on Eilean-Uamhain,
beyond Lunga in the Cairnburg Isles. A
few years ago, off Callachan Point, he saw the
two seals, and heard, though he did not see,
the cailliach. And that which I tell you&mdash;Christ&rsquo;s
Cross before me&mdash;is a true thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the time that Phadruic was speaking,
I saw that Ivor McLean looked away: either
as though he heard nothing, or did not wish
to hear. There was dream in his eyes; I saw
that, so said nothing for a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Ivor?&rdquo; I asked at last, in a
low voice. He started, and looked at me
strangely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you be asking that for? What
are you doing in my mind, that is secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that you are brooding over something.
Will you not tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her,&rdquo; said Phadruic quietly.</p>
<p>But Ivor kept silent. There was a look in
his eyes which I understood. Thereafter we
sailed on, with no word in the boat at all.</p>
<p>That night, a dark, rainy night it was, with
an uplift wind beating high over against the
hidden moon, I went to the cottage where
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
Ivor McLean lived with his old deaf mother,
deaf nigh upon twenty years, ever since the
night of the nights when she heard the women
whisper that Callum, her husband, was among
the drowned, after a death-wind had blown.</p>
<p>When I entered, he was sitting before the
flaming coal-fire; for on Iona now, by decree
of MacCailin M&ograve;r, there is no more peat
burned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will tell me now, Ivor?&rdquo; was all I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I will be telling you now. And the
reason why I did not tell you before was
because it is not a wise or a good thing to
tell ancient stories about the sea while still on
the running wave. Macrae should not have
done that thing. It may be we shall suffer
for it when next we go out with the nets.
We were to go to-night; but no, not I, no
no, for sure, not for all the herring in the
Sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it an ancient <i>sgeul</i>, Ivor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay. I am not for knowing the age of
these things. It may be as old as the days
of the F&eacute;inn for all I know. It has come
down to us. Alasdair MacAlasdair of Tiree,
him that used to boast of having all the stories
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
of Colum and Brighde, it was he told it to the
mother of my mother, and she to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this and that; but there is no harm
in saying it is called the Dark Nameless One.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Dark Nameless One!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is this way. But will you ever have
been hearing of the MacOdrums of Uist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay: the Sliochd-nan-r&ograve;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so. God knows. The Sliochd-nan-r&ograve;n
... the progeny of the Seal....
Well, well, no man knows what moves in the
shadow of life. And now I will be telling you
that old ancient tale, as it was given to me by
the mother of my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">On a day of the days, Colum was walking
alone by the sea-shore. The monks were at
the hoe or the spade, and some milking the
kye, and some at the fishing. They say
it was on the first day of the <i>Faoilleach
Geamhraidh</i>, the day that is called <i>Am fheill
Brighde</i>.</p>
<p>The holy man had wandered on to where
the rocks are, opposite to Soa. He was
praying and praying, and it is said that
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
whenever he prayed aloud, the barren egg
in the nest would quicken, and the blighted
bud unfold, and the butterfly cleave its shroud.</p>
<p>Of a sudden he came upon a great black seal,
lying silent on the rocks, with wicked eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My blessing upon you, O R&ograve;n,&rdquo; he said
with the good kind courteousness that was his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Droch spadadh ort</i>,&rdquo; answered the seal.
&ldquo;A bad end to you, Colum of the Gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, now,&rdquo; said Colum angrily, &ldquo;I am
knowing by that curse that you are no friend
of Christ, but of the evil pagan faith out of
the north. For here I am known ever as
Colum the White, or as Colum the Saint; and
it is only the Picts and the wanton Normen
who deride me because of the holy white robe
I wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; replied the seal, speaking the
good Gaelic as though it were the tongue of
the deep sea, as God knows it may be for
all you, I, or the blind wind can say;
&ldquo;Well, well, let that thing be: it&rsquo;s a wave-way
here or a wave-way there. But now if
it is a Druid you are, whether of Fire or of
Christ, be telling me where my woman is,
and where my little daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>At this, Colum looked at him for a long
while. Then he knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a man you were once, O R&ograve;n?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe ay and maybe no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with that thick Gaelic that you
have, it will be out of the north isles you
come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a true thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am for knowing at last who and
what you are. You are one of the race of
Odrum the Pagan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am not denying it, Colum. And
what is more, I am Angus MacOdrum,
Aonghas mac Torcall mhic Odrum, and the
name I am known by is Black Angus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fitting name too,&rdquo; said Colum the
Holy, &ldquo;because of the black sin in your
heart, and the black end God has in store
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Black Angus laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is there laughter upon you, Man-Seal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is because of the good company
I&rsquo;ll be having. But, now, give me the word:
Are you for having seen or heard aught of
a woman called Kirsteen McVurich?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kirsteen&mdash;Kirsteen&mdash;that is the good
name of a nun it is, and no sea-wanton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a name here or a name there is soft
sand. And so you cannot be for telling me
where my woman is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then a stake for your belly, and the nails
through your hands, thirst on your tongue,
and the corbies at your eyne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, with that, Black Angus louped into
the green water, and the hoarse wild laugh
of him sprang into the air and fell dead
against the cliff like a wind-spent mew.</p>
<p>Colum went slowly back to the brethren,
brooding deep. &ldquo;God is good,&rdquo; he said in a
low voice, again and again; and each time
that he spoke there came a fair sweet daisy
into the grass, or a yellow bird rose up, with
song to it for the first time wonderful and
sweet to hear.</p>
<p>As he drew near to the House of God he
met Murtagh, an old monk of the ancient old
race of the isles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Kirsteen McVurich, Murtagh?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a good servant of Christ, she
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
was, in the south isles, O Colum, till Black
Angus won her to the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nigh upon a thousand years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Colum stared in amaze. But
Murtagh was a man of truth, nor did he
speak in allegories. &ldquo;Ay, Colum, my father,
nigh upon a thousand years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can mortal sin live as long as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, it endureth. Long, long ago, before
Ois&igrave;n sang, before Fionn, before Cuchullin
was a glorious great prince, and in the days
when the Tuatha-De Dan&agrave;nn were sole lords
in all green Banba, Black Angus made the
woman Kirsteen McVurich leave the place of
prayer and go down to the sea-shore, and
there he leaped upon her and made her his
prey, and she followed him into the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is death above her now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She is the woman that weaves the
sea-spells at the wild place out yonder that
is known as Earraid: she that is called <i>an-cailleach-uisge</i>,
the sea-witch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why was Black Angus for the seeking
her here and the seeking her there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Doom. It is Adam&rsquo;s first wife
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
she is, that sea-witch over there, where the
foam is ever in the sharp fangs of the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who will he be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His body is the body of Angus the son
of Torcall of the race of Odrum, for all that
a seal he is to the seeming; but the soul of
him is Judas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black Judas, Murtagh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, Black Judas, Colum.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">But with that, Ivor Macrae rose abruptly
from before the fire, saying that he would
speak no more that night. And truly enough
there was a wild, lone, desolate cry in the
wind, and a slapping of the waves one upon
the other with an eerie laughing sound, and
the screaming of a sea-mew that was like a
human thing.</p>
<p>So I touched the shawl of his mother, who
looked up with startled eyes and said, &ldquo;God
be with us&rdquo;; and then I opened the door,
and the salt smell of the wrack was in my
nostrils, and the great drowning blackness of
the night.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2><span class="h2line1">THE SMOOTHING OF THE HAND</span></h2>
<p>Glad am I that wherever and whenever I
listen intently I can hear the looms of Nature
weaving Beauty and Music. But some of the
most beautiful things are learned otherwise&mdash;by
hazard, in the Way of Pain, or at the Gate
of Sorrow.</p>
<p>I learned two things on the day when I
saw Sheumas McIan dead upon the heather.
He of whom I speak was the son of Ian
McIan Alltnalee, but was known throughout
the home straths and the countries beyond as
Sheumas Dhu, Black James, or, to render the
subtler meaning implied in this instance, James
the Dark One. I had wondered occasionally
at the designation, because Sheumas, if not
exactly fair, was not dark. But the name was
given to him, as I learned later, because, as
commonly rumoured, he knew that which he
should not have known.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>I had been spending some weeks with Alasdair
McIan and his wife Silis (who was my
foster-sister), at their farm of Ardoch, high in
a remote hill country. One night we were
sitting before the peats, listening to the wind
crying amid the corries, though, ominously as
it seemed to us, there was not a breath in the
rowan-tree that grew in the sun&rsquo;s-way by the
house. Silis had been singing, but silence had
come upon us. In the warm glow from the
fire we saw each other&rsquo;s faces. There the
silence lay, strangely still and beautiful, as
snow in moonlight. Silis&rsquo;s song was one of
the <i>Dana Spioradail</i>, known in Gaelic as the
Hymn of the Looms. I cannot recall it, nor
have I ever heard or in any way encountered
it again.</p>
<p>It had a lovely refrain, I know not whether
its own or added by Silis. I have heard her
chant it to other runes and songs. Now, when
too late, my regret is deep that I did not take
from her lips more of those sorrowful, strange
songs or chants, with their ancient Celtic
melodies, so full of haunting sweet melancholy,
which she loved so well. It was with this
refrain that, after a long stillness, she startled
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
us that October night. I remember the
sudden light in the eyes of Alasdair McIan,
and the beat at my heart, when, like rain in
a wood, her voice fell unawares upon us out
of the silence:</p>
<p><i>Oh! oh! ohrone, arone! Oh! oh! mo ghraidh, mo chridhe!
Oh! oh! mo ghraidh, mo chridhe!</i><a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The wail, and the sudden break in the
second line, had always upon me an effect of
inexpressible pathos. Often that sad wind-song
has been in my ears, when I have been
thinking of many things that are passed and
are passing.</p>
<p>I know not what made Silis so abruptly
begin to sing, and with that wailing couplet
only, or why she lapsed at once into silence
again. Indeed, my remembrance of the incident
at all is due to the circumstance that
shortly after Silis had turned her face to the
peats again, a knock came to the door, and
then Sheumas Dhu entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you sing that lament, Silis, sister
of my father?&rdquo; he asked, after he had seated
himself beside me, and spread his thin hands
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
against the peat glow, so that the flame seemed
to enter within the flesh.</p>
<p>Silis turned to her nephew, and looked at
him, as I thought, questioningly. But she did
not speak. He, too, said nothing more, either
forgetful of his question, or content with what
he had learned or failed to learn through her
silence.</p>
<p>The wind had come down from the corries
before Sheumas rose to go. He said he was
not returning to Alltnalee, but was going upon
the hill, for a big herd of deer had come over
the ridge of Mel M&ograve;r. Sheumas, though skilled
in all hill and forest craft, was not a sure shot,
as was his kinsman and my host, Alasdair
McIan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will need help,&rdquo; I remember Alasdair
Ardoch saying mockingly, adding, &ldquo;<i>Co dhiubh
is fhearr let mise thoir sealladh na f&agrave;ileadh
dhiubh?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, Whether would you
rather me to deprive them of sight or smell?</p>
<p>This is a familiar saying among the old
sportsmen in my country, where it is believed
that a few favoured individuals have the
power to deprive deer of either sight or
smell, as the occasion suggests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dhuit ci&agrave;r nan carn!</i>&mdash;The gloom of the
rocks be upon you!&rdquo; replied Sheumas, sullenly;
&ldquo;mayhap the hour is come when the
red stag will sniff at my nostrils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that dark saying he went. None of
us saw him again alive.</p>
<p>Was it a forewarning? I have often wondered.
Or had he sight of the shadow?</p>
<p>It was three days after this, and shortly
after sunrise, that, on crossing the south slope
of Mel M&ograve;r with Alasdair Ardoch, we came
suddenly upon the body of Sheumas, half submerged
in a purple billow of heather. It did
not, at the moment, occur to me that he was
dead. I had not known that his prolonged
absence had been noted, or that he had been
searched for. As a matter of fact, he must
have died immediately before our approach,
for his limbs were still loose, and he lay as
a sleeper lies.</p>
<p>Alasdair kneeled and raised his kinsman&rsquo;s
head. When it lay upon the purple tussock,
the warmth and glow from the sunlit ling
gave a fugitive deceptive light to the pale
face. I know not whether the sun can have
any chemic action upon the dead. But it
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
seemed to me that a dream rose to the face
of Sheumas, like one of those submarine
flowers that are said to rise at times and be
visible for a moment in the hollow of a wave.
The dream, the light, waned; and there was a
great stillness and white peace where the
trouble had been. &ldquo;It is the Smoothing of
the Hand,&rdquo; said Alasdair McIan, in a hushed
voice.</p>
<p>Often I had heard this lovely phrase in
the Western Isles, but always as applied to
sleep. When a fretful child suddenly falls
into quietude and deep slumber, an isles-woman
will say that it is because of the
Smoothing of the Hand. It is always a
profound sleep, and there are some who
hold it almost as a sacred thing, and never
to be disturbed.</p>
<p>So, thinking only of this, I whispered to
my friend to come away; that Sheumas was
dead weary with hunting upon the hills; that
he would awake in due time.</p>
<p>McIan looked at me, hesitated, and said
nothing. I saw him glance around. A few
yards away, beside a great boulder in the
heather, a small rowan stood, flickering its
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
feather-like shadows across the white wool of
a ewe resting underneath. He moved thitherward
slowly, plucked a branch heavy with
scarlet berries, and then, having returned,
laid it across the breast of his kinsman.</p>
<p>I knew now what was that passing of the
trouble in the face of Sheumas Dhu, what
that sudden light was, that calming of the
sea, that ineffable quietude. It was the
Smoothing of the Hand.</p>

<p><i>This story is one of the Achanna series (see
&ldquo;The D&agrave;n-nan-R&ograve;n&rdquo; and &ldquo;Green Branches&rdquo;
in Vol. III., &ldquo;Tragic Romances&rdquo;). See also
the note to these two tales, apposite to the use
of the forename Gloom and the surname
Achanna.</i></p>
<p><i>The forename Alison is properly a woman&rsquo;s

occurrence of &lsquo;Alison&rsquo; as a surname.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<h2><span class="h2line1">THE ANOINTED MAN</span></h2>
<p>Of the seven Achannas&mdash;sons of Robert
Achanna of Achanna in Galloway, self-exiled
in the far north because of a bitter feud with
his kindred&mdash;who lived upon Eilanmore in
the Summer Isles, there was not one who
was not, in more or less degree, or at some
time or other, f&euml;y.</p>
<p>Doubtless I shall have occasion to allude to
one and all again, and certainly to the eldest
and youngest: for they were the strangest folk
I have known or met anywhere in the Celtic
lands, from the sea-pastures of the Solway to
the kelp-strewn beaches of Lewis. Upon
James, the seventh son, the doom of his
people fell last and most heavily. Some day
I may tell the full story of his strange life
and tragic undoing, and of his piteous end.
As it happened, I knew best the eldest and
youngest of the brothers, Alison and James.
Of the others, Robert, Allan, William, Marcus,
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
and Gloom, none save the last-named survives,
if peradventure <i>he</i> does, or has been seen of
man for many years past. Of Gloom (strange
and unaccountable name, which used to terrify
me&mdash;the more so as, by the savagery of fate,
it was the name of all names suitable for
Robert Achanna&rsquo;s sixth son) I know nothing
beyond the fact that, ten years or more ago,
he was a Jesuit priest in Rome, a bird of
passage, whence come and whither bound no
inquiries of mine could discover. Two years
ago a relative told me that Gloom was dead;
that he had been slain by some Mexican noble
in an old city of Hispaniola, beyond the seas.
Doubtless the news was founded on truth,
though I have ever a vague unrest when I
think of Gloom; as though he were travelling
hitherward, as though his feet, on some urgent
errand, were already white with the dust of
the road that leads to my house.</p>
<p>But now I wish to speak only of Alison
Achanna. He was a friend whom I loved,
though he was a man of close on forty and
I a girl less than half his years. We had
much in common, and I never knew anyone
more companionable, for all that he was called
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
&ldquo;Silent Ally.&rdquo; He was tall, gaunt, loosely-built.
His eyes were of that misty blue
which smoke takes when it rises in the woods.
I used to think them like the tarns that lay
amid the canna and gale-surrounded swamps
in Uist, where I was wont to dream as a
child.</p>
<p>I had often noticed the light on his face
when he smiled&mdash;a light of such serene joy as
young mothers have sometimes over the cradles
of their firstborn. But for some reason I had
never wondered about it, not even when I heard
and dimly understood the half-contemptuous,
half-reverent mockery with which, not only
Alison&rsquo;s brothers, but even his father, at times
used towards him. Once, I remember, I was
puzzled when, on a bleak day in a stormy
August, I overheard Gloom say, angrily and
scoffingly, &ldquo;There goes the Anointed Man!&rdquo;
I looked, but all I could see was that, despite
the dreary cold, despite the ruined harvest,
despite the rotting potato-crop, Alison walked
slowly onward, smiling, and with glad eyes
brooding upon the grey lands around and
beyond him.</p>
<p>It was nearly a year thereafter&mdash;I remember
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
the date, because it was that of my last visit
to Eilanmore&mdash;that I understood more fully.
I was walking westward with Alison towards
sundown. The light was upon his face as
though it came from within; and when I
looked again, half in awe, I saw that there
was no glamour out of the west, for the evening
was dull and threatening rain. He was
in sorrow. Three months before, his brothers
Allan and William had been drowned; a
month later, his brother Robert had sickened,
and now sat in the ingle from morning till
the covering of the peats, a skeleton almost,
shivering, and morosely silent, with large staring
eyes. On the large bed in the room
above the kitchen old Robert Achanna lay,
stricken with paralysis. It would have been
unendurable for me but for Alison and James,
and, above all, for my loved girl-friend, Anne
Gillespie, Achanna&rsquo;s niece, and the sunshine
of his gloomy household.</p>
<p>As I walked with Alison I was conscious
of a well-nigh intolerable depression. The
house we had left was so mournful; the bleak
sodden pastures were so mournful; so mournful
was the stony place we were crossing,
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
silent but for the thin crying of the curlews;
and, above all, so mournful was the sound of
the ocean as, unseen, it moved sobbingly round
the isle: so beyond words distressing was all
this to me, that I stopped abruptly, meaning
to go no farther, but to return to the house,
where at least there was warmth, and where
Anne would sing for me as she spun.</p>
<p>But when I looked up into my companion&rsquo;s
face I saw in truth the light that shone from
within. His eyes were upon a forbidding
stretch of ground, where the blighted potatoes
rotted among a wilderness of round skull-white
stones. I remember them still, these strange
far-blue eyes, lamps of quiet joy, lamps of
peace they seemed to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you looking at Achnacarn?&rdquo; (as the
tract was called), I asked, in what I am sure
was a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Alison slowly; &ldquo;I am looking.
It is beautiful&mdash;beautiful. O God, how
beautiful is this lovely world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know not what made me act so, but I
threw myself on a heathery ridge close by,
and broke out into convulsive sobbings.</p>
<p>Alison stooped, lifted me in his strong arms,
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
and soothed me with soft, caressing touches
and quieting words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, my fawn, what is it? What is
the trouble?&rdquo; he asked again and again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is <i>you</i>&mdash;it is <i>you</i>, Alison,&rdquo; I managed
to say coherently at last. &ldquo;It terrifies me to
hear you speak as you did a little ago. You
must be f&euml;y. Why&mdash;why do you call that
hateful, hideous field beautiful on this dreary
day&mdash;and&mdash;and after all that has happened,&mdash;O
Alison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this, I remember, he took his plaid and
put it upon the wet heather, and then drew
me thither, and seated himself and me beside
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not beautiful, my fawn?&rdquo; he asked,
with tears in his eyes. Then, without waiting
for my answer, he said quietly, &ldquo;Listen, dear,
and I will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was strangely still&mdash;breathless, he seemed
to me&mdash;for a minute or more. Then he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was little more than a child&mdash;a boy just
in my teens&mdash;when something happened, something
that came down the Rainbow-Arches of
Cathair-S&igrave;th.&rdquo; He paused here, perhaps to
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
see if I followed, which I did, familiar as I
was with all fairy-lore. &ldquo;I was out upon the
heather, in the time when the honey oozes in
the bells and cups. I had always loved the
island and the sea. Perhaps I was foolish,
but I was so glad with my joy that golden
day that I threw myself on the ground and
kissed the hot, sweet ling, and put my hands
and arms into it, sobbing the while with my
vague, strange yearning. At last I lay still,
nerveless, with my eyes closed. Suddenly I
was aware that two tiny hands had come up
through the spires of the heather, and were
pressing something soft and fragrant upon my
eyelids. When I opened them, I could see
nothing unfamiliar. No one was visible. But
I heard a whisper: &lsquo;Arise and go away from
this place at once; and this night do not
venture out, lest evil befall you.&rsquo; So I rose,
trembling, and went home. Thereafter I was
the same, and yet not the same. Never could
I see as they saw, what my father and brothers
or the isle-folk looked upon as ugly or dreary.
My father was wroth me many times, and
called me a fool. Whenever my eyes fell
upon those waste and desolated spots, they
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
seemed to me passing fair, radiant with lovely
light. At last my father grew so bitter that,
mocking me the while, he bade me go to
the towns and see there the squalor and
sordid hideousness wherein men dwelled. But
thus it was with me: in the places they call
slums, and among the smoke of factories and
the grime of destitution, I could see all that
other men saw, only as vanishing shadows.
What I saw was lovely, beautiful with strange
glory, and the faces of men and women were
sweet and pure, and their souls were white.
So, weary and bewildered with my unwilling
quest, I came back to Eilanmore. And on
the day of my home-coming, Morag was there&mdash;Morag
of the Falls. She turned to my
father and called him blind and foolish. &lsquo;He
has the white light upon his brows,&rsquo; she said
of me; &lsquo;I can see it, like the flicker-light in
a wave when the wind&rsquo;s from the south in
thunder-weather. He has been touched with
the Fairy Ointment. The Guid Folk know
him. It will be thus with him till the day
of his death, if a <i>duinshee</i> can die, being
already a man dead yet born anew. He
upon whom the Fairy Ointment has been
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
laid must see all that is ugly and hideous
and dreary and bitter through a glamour of
beauty. Thus it hath been since the Mhic-Alpine
ruled from sea to sea, and thus is it
with the man Alison your son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all, my fawn; and that is why my
brothers, when they are angry, sometimes call
me the Anointed Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;That is all.&rdquo; Yes, perhaps. But oh, Alison
Achanna, how often have I thought of that
most precious treasure you found in the
heather, when the bells were sweet with
honey-ooze! Did the wild bees know of it?
Would that I could hear the soft hum of
their gauzy wings.</p>
<p>Who of us would not barter the best of
all our possessions&mdash;and some there are who
would surrender all&mdash;to have one touch laid
upon the eyelids&mdash;one touch of the Fairy
Ointment? But the place is far, and the
hour is hidden. No man may seek that for
which there can be no quest.</p>
<p>Only the wild bees know of it; but I think
they must be the bees of Magh-Mell. And
there no man that liveth may wayfare&mdash;<i>yet</i>.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<h2><span class="h2line1">THE HILLS OF RUEL</span></h2>
<p>One night Eilidh and Isla and I were sitting
before a fire, of pine logs blazing upon peats,
and listening to the snow as it whispered
against the walls of the house. The wind
crying in the glen, and the tumult of the
hill-stream in spate, were behind the white
confused rumour of the snow.</p>
<p>Eilidh was singing low to herself, and Isla
was watching her. I could not look long at
him, because of the welling upward of the
tears that were in my heart. I know not
why they were there.</p>
<p>At last, after a pause wherein each
sat intent listening to the disarray without,
Eilidh&rsquo;s sweet thrilling voice slid through
the silence&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Over the hills and far away,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">That is the tune I heard one day.</p>
<p class="t0">Oh that I too might hear the cruel</p>
<p class="t0">Honey-sweet folk of the Hills of Ruel.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>I saw a shadow go into Isla&rsquo;s eyes. So I
stirred and spoke to my cousin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Isla, who were born on the Hills of
Ruel, should sure have seen something of the
honey-sweet folk, as they are called in Eilidh&rsquo;s
song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer straightway, and I saw
Eilidh furtively glance at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you a story,&rdquo; he said at last simply.</p>
<p class="tb">Long, long ago there was a beautiful
woman, and her name was Etain, and she was
loved by a man. I am not for remembering
the name of that man, for it is a story of the
far-off days: but he was a prince. I will call
him Art, and mayhap he was a son of that
Art the Solitary who was wont to hear the
songs of the hidden people and to see the
moonshine dancers.</p>
<p>This Art loved Etain, and she him. So
one day he took her to his d&ucirc;n, and she
was his wife. But, and this was an ill thing
for one like Art, who was a poet and dreamer,
he loved this woman overmuch. She held his
life in the hollow of her hand. Nevertheless,
and in her own way, she loved him truly: and
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
for him, blind with the Dream against his eyes,
all might have been well, but for one thing. For
Art, who was no coward, feared one hazard,
and that was death: not his own death,
and not even the death of Etain, but death.
He loved Etain beyond the narrow frontiers
of life: and at that indrawing shadow he
stood appalled.</p>
<p>One day, when his longing was great upon
him, he went out alone upon the Hills of Ruel.
There a man met him, a stranger, comely beyond
all men he had seen, with dark eyes of
dream, and a shadowy smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and so, Art the Dreamer,
thou art eager to know what way thou mayest
meet Etain, in that hour when the shadow of
the Shadow is upon thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so; though I know neither thee nor
the way by which my name is known unto thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for sure I am only a wandering
singer. But, now that we are met, I will
sing to you, Art my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Art looked at him frowningly. This man who
called him lord spake with heedless sovereignty.</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden, song eddied off the
lips of the man, the air of it marvellous light
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
and of a haunting strangeness: and the words
were those that Eilidh there sang by the fire.</p>
<p>Through the dusk of silence which that
song made in his brain, Art saw the stranger
draw from the fawnskin, slung round his
shoulders and held by a gold torque, a reed.
The man played upon it.</p>
<p>While he played, there was a stirring on
the Hills of Ruel. All the green folk were
there. They sang.</p>
<p>Art listened to their honey-sweet song,
and grew drowsy with the joy and peace of
it. And one there was who sang of deathless
life; and Art, murmuring the name of Etain,
fell asleep.</p>
<p>He was an old, old man when he awoke,
and the grey hair that lay down the side of
his face was damp with unremembered tears.
But, not knowing this, he rose and cried
&ldquo;Etain,&rdquo; &ldquo;Etain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he reached his d&ucirc;n there was no
Etain there. He sat down by old ashes, where
the wind blew through a chink, and pondered.
An old man entered at dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Etain?&rdquo; Art asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Etain, the wife of Midir?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;No; Etain, the wife of Art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man mumbled through his open
jaws:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these years since I was young, Etain
the wife of Art has been Etain the wife of
Midir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is Midir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midir is the King of the World; he, they
say, who makes sand of women&rsquo;s hearts and
dust of men&rsquo;s hopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have dreamed but an idle dream?&rdquo;
Art cried, with his heart breaking in a sob
within him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, for if Art you be, you have been
dreaming a long dream upon the Hills of Ruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when Art, old now and weak, turned
to go back to the honey-sweet folk upon the
Hills of Ruel, so that he might dream his
dream again, he heard Midir laughing, and
he died.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;And that is all,&rdquo; ended Isla abruptly,
looking neither at Eilidh nor at me, and
staring into the flame of the peats.</p>
<p>But Eilidh smiled no more to herself that
night, and no more sang below her breath.</p>

<h2><span class="h2line1">THE FISHER OF MEN</span></h2>
<p>When old Sheen nic L&egrave;oid came back to the
croft, after she had been to the burn at the
edge of the green airidh, where she had washed
the <i>claar</i> that was for the potatoes at the
peeling, she sat down before the peats.</p>
<p>She was white with years. The mountain
wind was chill, too, for all that the sun had
shone throughout the midsummer day. It
was well to sit before the peat-fire.</p>
<p>The croft was on the slope of a mountain
and had the south upon it. North, south,
east, and west, other great slopes reached upward
like hollow green waves frozen into silence
by the very wind that curved them so, and
freaked their crests into peaks and jagged
pinnacles. Stillness was in that place for ever
and ever. What though the Gorromalt Water
foamed down Ben Nair, where the croft was,
and made a hoarse voice for aye surrendering
sound to silence? What though at times the
stones fell from the ridges of Ben Chaisteal
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
and Maolm&ograve;r, and clattered down the barren
declivities till they were slung in the tangled
meshes of whin and juniper? What though
on stormy dawns the eagle screamed as he
fought against the wind that graved a thin
line upon the aged front of Ben Mulad, where
his eyrie was: or that the kestrel cried above
the rabbit-burrows in the strath: or that the
hill-fox barked, or that the curlew wailed, or
that the scattered sheep made an endless
mournful crying? What were these but the
ministers of silence?</p>
<p>There was no blue smoke in the strath
except from the one turf cot. In the hidden
valley beyond Ben Nair there was a hamlet,
and nigh upon three-score folk lived there;
but that was over three miles away. Sheen
Macleod was alone in that solitary place, save
for her son Alasdair M&ograve;r Og. &ldquo;Young Alasdair&rdquo;
he was still, though the grey feet of
fifty years had marked his hair. Alasdair Og
he was while Alasdair Ruadh mac Chalum
mhic L&egrave;oid, that was his father, lived. But
when Alasdair Ruadh changed, and Sheen was
left a mourning woman, he that was their son
was Alasdair Og still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>She had sore weariness that day. For all
that, it was not the weight of the burden that
made her go in and out of the afternoon sun,
and sit by the red glow of the peats, brooding
deep.</p>
<p>When, nigh upon an hour later, Alasdair
came up the slope, and led the kye to the
byre, she did not hear him: nor had she sight
of him, when his shadow flickered in before
him and lay along the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old woman,&rdquo; he said to himself, bending
his head because of the big height that
was his, and he there so heavy and strong,
and tender, too, for all the tangled black beard
and the wild hill-eyes that looked out under
bristling grey-black eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old woman, and she with the tired
heart that she has. Ay, ay, for sure the
weeks lap up her shadow, as the sayin&rsquo; is.
She will be thinking of him that is gone. Ay,
or maybe the old thoughts of her are goin&rsquo;
back on their own steps, down this glen an&rsquo;
over that hill an&rsquo; away beyont that strath, an&rsquo;
this corrie an&rsquo; that moor. Well, well, it is a
good love, that of the mother. Sure a bitter
pain it will be to me when there&rsquo;s no old
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
grey hair there to stroke. It&rsquo;s quiet here,
terrible quiet, God knows, to Himself be the
blessin&rsquo; for this an&rsquo; for that; but when she
has the white sleep at last, then it&rsquo;ll be a
sore day for me, an&rsquo; one that I will not be
able to bear to hear the sheep callin&rsquo;, callin&rsquo;,
callin&rsquo; through the rain on the hills here,
and Gorromalt Water an&rsquo; no other voice to
be with me on that day of the days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She heard a faint sigh, and stirred a moment,
but did not look round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muim&rsquo;-&agrave;-ghraidh, is it tired you are, an&rsquo;
this so fine a time, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a quick gesture, the old woman glanced
at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, child, is that you indeed? Well, I am
glad of that, for I have the trouble again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What trouble, Muim&rsquo; ghaolaiche?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the old woman did not answer. Wearily
she turned her face to the peat-glow again.</p>
<p>Alasdair seated himself on the big wooden
chair to her right. For a time he stayed
silent thus, staring into the red heart of the
peats. What was the gloom upon the old
heart that he loved? What trouble was it?</p>
<p>At last he rose and put meal and water into
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
the iron pot, and stirred the porridge while it
seethed and sputtered. Then he poured boiling
water upon the tea in the brown jenny,
and put the new bread and the sweet-milk
scones on the rude deal board that was the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, dear tired old heart,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
let us give thanks to the Being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessings and thanks,&rdquo; she said, and turned
round.</p>
<p>Alasdair poured out the porridge, and watched
the steam rise. Then he sat down, with a knife
in one hand and the brown-white loaf in the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O God,&rdquo; he said, in the low voice he had in
the kirk when the Bread and Wine were given&mdash;&ldquo;O
God, be giving us now thy blessing, and
have the thanks. And give us peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peace there was in the sorrowful old eyes
of the mother. The two ate in silence. The
big clock that was by the bed <i>tick-tacked, tick-tacked</i>.
A faint sputtering came out of a peat
that had bog-gas in it. Shadows moved in the
silence, and met and whispered and moved into
deep, warm darkness. There was peace.</p>
<p>There was still a red flush above the hills
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
in the west when the mother and son sat in
the ingle again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, mother-my-heart?&rdquo; Alasdair
asked at last, putting his great red hand upon
the woman&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>She looked at him for a moment. When
she spoke she turned away her gaze again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foxes have holes, and the fowls of the air
have their places of rest, but the Son of Man
hath not where to lay his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what then, dear? Sure, it is the deep
meaning you have in that grey old head that
I&rsquo;m loving so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, lennav-aghray, there is meaning to my
words. It is old I am, and the hour of my
hours is near. I heard a voice outside the
window last night. It is a voice I will not
be hearing, no, not for seventy years. It was
cradle-sweet, it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, and there was silence for a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear,&rdquo; she began again, wearily, and
in a low, weak voice, &ldquo;it is more tired and more
tired I am every day now this last month. Two
Sabbaths ago I woke, and there were bells in
the air: and you are for knowing well, Alasdair,
that no kirk-bells ever rang in Strath-Nair. At
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
edge o&rsquo; dark on Friday, and by the same token
the thirteenth day it was, I fell asleep, and
dreamed the mools were on my breast, and
that the roots of the white daisies were in the
hollows where the eyes were that loved you,
Alasdair, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked at her with troubled gaze.
No words would come. Of what avail to speak
when there is nothing to be said? God sends
the gloom upon the cloud, and there is rain:
God sends the gloom upon the hill, and there
is mist: God sends the gloom upon the sun,
and there is winter. It is God, too, sends the
gloom upon the soul, and there is change.
The swallow knows when to lift up her wing
overagainst the shadow that creeps out of the
north: the wild swan knows when the smell
of snow is behind the sun: the salmon, lone
in the brown pool among the hills, hears
the deep sea, and his tongue pants for
salt, and his fins quiver, and he knows that
his time is come, and that the sea calls. The
doe knows when the fawn hath not yet
quaked in her belly: is not the violet more
deep in the shadowy dewy eyes? The woman
knows when the babe hath not yet stirred a
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
little hand: is not the wild-rose on her cheek
more often seen, and are not the shy tears
moist on quiet hands in the dusk? How,
then, shall the soul not know when the change
is nigh at last? Is it a less thing than a reed,
which sees the yellow birch-gold adrift on the
lake, and the gown of the heather grow russet
when the purple has passed into the sky, and
the white bog-down wave grey and tattered
where the loneroid grows dark and pungent&mdash;which
sees, and knows that the breath of the
Death-Weaver at the Pole is fast faring along
the frozen norland peaks. It is more than a
reed, it is more than a wild doe on the hills,
it is more than a swallow lifting her wing
against the coming of the shadow, it is more
than a swan drunken with the savour of the
blue wine of the waves when the green Arctic
lawns are white and still. It is more than
these, which has the Son of God for brother,
and is clothed with light. God doth not extinguish
at the dark tomb what he hath litten
in the dark womb.</p>
<p>Who shall say that the soul knows not when
the bird is aweary of the nest, and the nest is
aweary of the wind? Who shall say that all
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
portents are vain imaginings? A whirling straw
upon the road is but a whirling straw: yet
the wind is upon the cheek almost ere it is
gone.</p>
<p>It was not for Alasdair &Ograve;g, then, to put a
word upon the saying of the woman that was
his mother, and was age-white, and could see
with the seeing of old wise eyes.</p>
<p>So all that was upon his lips was a sigh,
and the poor prayer that is only a breath
out of the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be telling me, grey sweetheart,&rdquo;
he said lovingly, at last&mdash;&ldquo;you will be telling
me what was behind the word that you said:
that about the foxes that have holes for the
hiding, poor beasts, and the birdeens wi&rsquo; their
nests, though the Son o&rsquo; Man hath not where
to lay his head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, Alasdair, my son that I bore long syne
an&rsquo; that I&rsquo;m leaving soon, I will be for telling
you that thing, an&rsquo; now too, for I am knowing
what is in the dark this night o&rsquo; the nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Old Sheen put her head back wearily on the
chair, and let her hands lie, long and white,
palm-downward upon her knees. The peat-glow
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
warmed the dull grey that lurked under
her closed eyes and about her mouth, and in
the furrowed cheeks. Alasdair moved nearer
and took her right hand in his, where it lay
like a tired sheep between two scarped rocks.
Gently he smoothed her hand, and wondered
why so frail and slight a creature as this small
old wizened woman could have mothered a
great swarthy man like himself&mdash;he a man
now, with his two score and ten years, and yet
but a boy there at the dear side of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was this way, Alasdair-mochree,&rdquo; she
went on in her low thin voice&mdash;like a wind-worn
leaf, the man that was her son thought. &ldquo;It
was this way. I went down to the burn to
wash the <i>claar</i>, and when I was there I saw a
wounded fawn in the bracken. The big sad
eyes of it were like those of Maisie, poor lass,
when she had the birthing that was her going-call.
I went through the bracken, and down
by the Gorromalt, and into the Shadowy
Glen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I was there, and standing by the
running water, I saw a man by the stream-side.
He was tall, but spare and weary: and the clothes
upon him were poor and worn. He had sorrow.
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
When he lifted his head at me, I saw the
tears. Dark, wonderful, sweet eyes they were.
His face was pale. It was not the face of a
man of the hills. There was no red in it, and
the eyes looked in upon themselves. He was
a fair man, with the white hands that a woman
has, a woman like the Bantighearna of Glenchaisteal
over yonder. His voice, too, was a
voice like that: in the softness, and the sweet,
quiet sorrow, I am meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The word that I gave him was in the
English: for I thought he was like a man out
of <i>Sasunn</i>, or of the southlands somewhere.
But he answered me in the Gaelic: sweet,
good Gaelic like that of the Bioball over there,
to Himself be the praise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And is it the way down the Strath you are
seeking,&rsquo; I asked: &lsquo;and will you not be coming
up to the house yonder, poor cot though it is,
and have a sup of milk, and a rest if it&rsquo;s weary
you are?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are having my thanks for that,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;and it is as though I had both the good
rest and the cool sweet drink. But I am following
the flowing water here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is it for the fishing?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am a Fisher,&rsquo; he said, and the voice of
him was low and sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had no hat on his head, and the light
that streamed through a rowan-tree was in his
long hair. He had the pity of the poor in
his sorrowful grey eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And will you not sleep with us?&rsquo; I asked
again: &lsquo;that is, if you have no place to go to,
and are a stranger in this country, as I am
thinking you are; for I have never had sight
of you in the home-straths before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am a stranger,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I have no
home, and my father&rsquo;s house is a great way off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do not tell me, poor man,&rsquo; I said gently, for
fear of the pain, &lsquo;do not tell me if you would
fain not; but it is glad I will be if you will
give me the name you have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My name is Mac-an-t&rsquo;-Saoir,&rsquo; he answered
with the quiet deep gaze that was his. And
with that he bowed his head, and went on his
way, brooding deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was with a heavy heart I turned, and
went back through the bracken. A heavy heart,
for sure, and yet, oh peace too, cool dews of
peace. And the fawn was there: healed, Alasdair,
healed, and whinny-bleating for its doe,
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
that stood on a rock wi&rsquo; lifted hoof an&rsquo; stared
down the glen to where the Fisher was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was at the burnside, a woman came
down the brae. She was fair to see, but the
tears were upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;have you seen a man going
this way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ay, for sure,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;but what man
would he be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He is called Mac-an-t&rsquo;-Saoir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, there are many men that are called
Son of the Carpenter. What will his own name
be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Iosa,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I looked at her, she was weaving
the wavy branches of a thorn near by, and
sobbing low, and it was like a wreath or crown
that she made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And who will you be, poor woman?&rsquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O my Son, my Son,&rsquo; she said, and put her
apron over her head and went down into the
Shadowy Glen, she weeping sore, too, at that,
poor woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now, Alasdair, my son, tell me what
thought you have about this thing that I have
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
told you. For I know well whom I met on the
brae there, and who the Fisher was. And when
I was at the peats here once more I sat down,
and my mind sank into myself. And it is
knowing the knowledge I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, dear, it is sore tired you are.
Have rest now. But sure there are many
men called Macintyre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, an&rsquo; what Gael that you know will be
for giving you his surname like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alasdair had no word for that. He rose to
put some more peats on the fire. When he
had done this, he gave a cry.</p>
<p>The whiteness that was on the mother&rsquo;s hair
was now in the face. There was no blood
there, or in the drawn lips. The light in the
old, dim eyes was like water after frost.</p>
<p>He took her hand in his. Clay-cold it was.
He let it go, and it fell straight by the chair,
stiff as the cromak he carried when he was
with the sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my God and my God,&rdquo; he whispered,
white with the awe, and the bitter cruel pain.</p>
<p>Then it was that he heard a knocking at
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; he cried hoarsely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Open, and let me in.&rdquo; It was a low, sweet
voice, but was that grey hour the time for a
welcome?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, but go in peace, whoever you are.
There is death here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open, and let me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, Alasdair, shaking like a reed in the
wind, unclasped the latch. A tall fair man, ill-clad
and weary, pale, too, and with dreaming
eyes, came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Beannachd Dhe an Tigh</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
blessing on this house, and on all here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same upon yourself,&rdquo; Alasdair said,
with the weary pain in his voice. &ldquo;And who
will you be? and forgive the asking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am called Mac-an-t&rsquo;-Saoir, and Iosa is the
name I bear&mdash;Jesus, the Son of the Carpenter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a good name. And is it good you
are seeking this night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a Fisher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s here an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s there. But
will you go to the Strath over the hill, and
tell the good man that is there, the minister,
Lachlan MacLachlan, that old Sheen nic L&egrave;oid,
wife of Alasdair Ruadh, is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that, Alasdair &Ograve;g.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;And how will you be knowing that, and
my name too, you that are called Macintyre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met the white soul of Sheen as it went
down by the Shadowy Glen a brief while ago.
She was singing a glad song, she was. She
had green youth in her eyes. And a man was
holding her by the hand. It was Alasdair
Ruadh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Alasdair fell on his knees. When
he looked up there was no one there. Through
the darkness outside the door, he saw a star
shining white, and leaping like a pulse.</p>
<p>It was three days after that day of shadow
that Sheen Macleod was put under the green
turf.</p>
<p>On each night, Alasdair &Ograve;g walked in the
Shadowy Glen, and there he saw a man fishing,
though ever afar off. Stooping he was, always,
and like a shadow at times. But he was the
man that was called Iosa Mac-an-t&rsquo;-Saoir&mdash;Jesus,
the Son of the Carpenter.</p>
<p>And on the night of the earthing he saw
the Fisher close by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord God,&rdquo; he said, with the hush on his
voice, and deep awe in his wondering eyes:
&ldquo;Lord God!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>And the Man looked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Night and day, Alasdair MacAlasdair,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;night and day I fish in the waters of
the world. And these waters are the waters
of grief, and the waters of sorrow, and the
waters of despair. And it is the souls of the
living I fish for. And lo, I say this thing unto
you, for you shall not see me again: <i>Go in
peace</i>. Go in peace, good soul of a poor man,
for thou hast seen the Fisher of Men.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span class="h2line1">THE LAST SUPPER</span></h2>
<p>The last time that the Fisher of Men was
seen in Strath-Nair was not of Alasdair Macleod
but of the little child, Art Macarthur, him that
was born of the woman Mary Gilchrist, that
had known the sorrow of women.</p>
<p>He was a little child, indeed, when, because
of his loneliness and having lost his way, he
lay sobbing among the bracken by the stream-side
in the Shadowy Glen.</p>
<p>When he was a man, and had reached the
gloaming of his years, he was loved of men
and women, for his songs are many and sweet,
and his heart was true, and he was a good
man and had no evil against any one.</p>
<p>It is he who saw the Fisher of Men when
he was but a little lad: and some say that it
was on the eve of the day that Alasdair &Ograve;g
died, though of this I know nothing. And
what he saw, and what he heard, was a moonbeam
that fell into the dark sea of his mind,
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
and sank therein, and filled it with light for
all the days of his life. A moonlit mind was
that of Art Macarthur: him that is known
best as Ian M&ograve;r, Ian M&ograve;r of the Hills, though
why he took the name of Ian Cameron is
known to none now but one person, and that
need not be for the telling here. He had
music always in his mind. I asked him once
why he heard what so few heard, but he smiled
and said only: &ldquo;When the heart is full of
love, cool dews of peace rise from it and fall
upon the mind: and that is when the song
of Joy is heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must have been because of this shining
of his soul that some who loved him thought
of him as one illumined. His mind was a
shell that held the haunting echo of the deep
seas: and to know him was to catch a breath
of the infinite ocean of wonder and mystery
and beauty of which he was the quiet oracle.
He has peace now, where he lies under the
heather upon a hillside far away: but the
Fisher of Men will send him hitherward again,
to put a light upon the wave and a gleam
upon the brown earth.</p>
<p>I will tell this <i>sgeul</i> as Ian M&ograve;r that
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
was the little child Art Macarthur, told it
to me.</p>
<p class="tb">Often and often it is to me all as a dream
that comes unawares. Often and often have
I striven to see into the green glens of the
mind whence it comes, and whither, in a flash,
in a rainbow gleam, it vanishes. When I seek
to draw close to it, to know whether it is a
winged glory out of the soul, or was indeed
a thing that happened to me in my tender
years, lo&mdash;it is a dawn drowned in day, a star
lost in the sun, the falling of dew.</p>
<p>But I will not be forgetting: no, never: no,
not till the silence of the grass is over my
eyes: I will not be forgetting that gloaming.</p>
<p>Bitter tears are those that children have.
All that we say with vain words is said by
them in this welling spray of pain. I had the
sorrow that day. Strange hostilities lurked in
the familiar bracken. The soughing of the
wind among the trees, the wash of the brown
water by my side, that had been companionable,
were voices of awe. The quiet light upon
the grass flamed.</p>
<p>The fierce people that lurked in shadow had
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
eyes for my helplessness. When the dark
came I thought I should be dead, devoured
of I knew not what wild creature. Would
mother never come, never come with saving
arms, with eyes like soft candles of home?</p>
<p>Then my sobs grew still, for I heard a step.
With dread upon me, poor wee lad that I was,
I looked to see who came out of the wilderness.
It was a man, tall and thin and worn,
with long hair hanging adown his face. Pale
he was as a moonlit cot on the dark moor,
and his voice was low and sweet. When I
saw his eyes I had no fear upon me at all.
I saw the mother-look in the grey shadow of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that you, Art lennavan-mo?&rdquo; he
said, as he stooped and lifted me.</p>
<p>I had no fear. The wet was out of my
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it you will be listening to now,
my little lad?&rdquo; he whispered, as he saw me
lean, intent, to catch I know not what.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am not for knowing:
but I thought I heard a music away down
there in the wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard it, for sure. It was a wondrous sweet
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
air, as of one playing the feadan in a dream.
Callum Dall, the piper, could give no rarer
music than that was; and Callum was a seventh
son, and was born in the moonshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come with me this night of the
nights, little Art?&rdquo; the man asked me, with
his lips touching my brow and giving me rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will indeed and indeed,&rdquo; I said.
And then I fell asleep.</p>
<p>When I awoke we were in the huntsman&rsquo;s
booth, that is at the far end of the Shadowy
Glen.</p>
<p>There was a long rough-hewn table in it, and
I stared when I saw bowls and a great jug of
milk and a plate heaped with oatcakes, and
beside it a brown loaf of rye-bread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Art,&rdquo; said he who carried me, &ldquo;are
you for knowing now who I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a prince, I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; was the
shy word that came to my mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, lennav-aghr&agrave;y, that is so. It is called
the Prince of Peace I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is to be eating all this?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the last supper,&rdquo; the prince said,
so low that I could scarce hear; and it seemed
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
to me that he whispered, &ldquo;For I die daily,
and ever ere I die the Twelve break bread
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then I saw that there were six bowls
of porridge on the one side and six on the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name, O prince?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iosa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you have no other name than
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am called Iosa mac Dhe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it living in this house you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay. But Art, my little lad, I will kiss
your eyes, and you shall see who sup with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that the prince that was called
Iosa kissed me on the eyes, and I saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will never be quite blind again,&rdquo; he
whispered, and that is why all the long years
of my years I have been glad in my soul.</p>
<p>What I saw was a thing strange and wonderful.
Twelve men sat at that table, and all
had eyes of love upon Iosa. But they were
not like any men I had ever seen. Tall and
fair and terrible they were, like morning in a
desert place; all save one, who was dark,
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
and had a shadow upon him and in his wild
eyes.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that each was clad in radiant
mist. The eyes of them were as stars through
that mist.</p>
<p>And each, before he broke bread, or put
spoon to the porridge that was in the bowl
before him, laid down upon the table three
shuttles.</p>
<p>Long I looked upon that company, but Iosa
held me in his arms, and I had no fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are these men?&rdquo; he asked me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sons of God,&rdquo; I said, I not knowing
what I said, for it was but a child I was.</p>
<p>He smiled at that. &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; he spoke to
the twelve men who sat at the table, &ldquo;behold
the little one is wiser than the wisest of ye.&rdquo;
At that all smiled with the gladness and the
joy, save one; him that was in the shadow.
He looked at me, and I remembered two
black lonely tarns upon the hillside, black
with the terror because of the kelpie and the
drowner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are these men?&rdquo; I whispered, with
the tremor on me that was come of the awe
I had.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are the Twelve Weavers, Art, my
little child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is their weaving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They weave for my Father, whose web
I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that I looked upon the prince, but I could
see no web.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not Iosa the Prince?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Web of Life, Art lennavan-mo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are the three shuttles that are
beside each Weaver?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know now that when I turned my child&rsquo;s-eyes
upon these shuttles I saw that they were
alive and wonderful, and never the same to
the seeing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are called <i>Beauty</i> and <i>Wonder</i> and
<i>Mystery</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that Iosa mac Dhe sat down and
talked with the Twelve. All were passing fair,
save him who looked sidelong out of dark
eyes. I thought each, as I looked at him,
more beautiful than any of his fellows; but
most I loved to look at the twain who sat
on either side of Iosa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be a Dreamer among men,&rdquo; said
the prince; &ldquo;so tell him who ye are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>Then he who was on the right turned his
eyes upon me. I leaned to him, laughing low
with the glad pleasure I had because of his
eyes and shining hair, and the flame as of
the blue sky that was his robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Weaver of Joy,&rdquo; he said. And
with that he took his three shuttles that were
called Beauty and Wonder and Mystery, and
he wove an immortal shape, and it went forth
of the room and out into the green world,
singing a rapturous sweet song.</p>
<p>Then he that was upon the left of Iosa the
Life looked at me, and my heart leaped. He,
too, had shining hair, but I could not tell
the colour of his eyes for the glory that was
in them. &ldquo;I am the Weaver of Love,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and I sit next the heart of Iosa.&rdquo; And
with that he took his three shuttles that were
called Beauty and Wonder and Mystery and
he wove an immortal shape, and it went forth
of the room and into the green world singing
a rapturous sweet song.</p>
<p>Even then, child as I was, I wished to look
on no other. None could be so passing fair,
I thought, as the Weaver of Joy and the Weaver
of Love.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>But a wondrous sweet voice sang in my
ears, and a cool, soft hand laid itself upon
my head, and the beautiful lordly one who
had spoken said, &ldquo;I am the Weaver of Death,&rdquo;
and the lovely whispering one who had lulled
me with rest said, &ldquo;I am the Weaver of Sleep.&rdquo;
And each wove with the shuttles of Beauty
and Wonder and Mystery, and I knew not
which was the more fair, and Death seemed
to me as Love, and in the eyes of Dream I
saw Joy.</p>
<p>My gaze was still upon the fair wonderful
shapes that went forth from these twain&mdash;from
the Weaver of Sleep, an immortal shape of
star-eyed Silence, and from the Weaver of
Death a lovely Dusk with a heart of hidden
flame&mdash;when I heard the voice of two others
of the Twelve. They were like the laughter
of the wind in the corn, and like the golden
fire upon that corn. And the one said, &ldquo;I am
the Weaver of Passion,&rdquo; and when he spoke
I thought that he was both Love and Joy, and
Death and Life, and I put out my hands.
&ldquo;It is Strength I give,&rdquo; he said, and he took
and kissed me. Then, while Iosa took me
again upon his knee, I saw the Weaver of
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
Passion turn to the white glory beside him,
him that Iosa whispered to me was the secret
of the world, and that was called &ldquo;The Weaver
of Youth.&rdquo; I know not whence nor how it
came, but there was a singing of skiey birds
when these twain took the shuttles of Beauty
and Wonder and Mystery, and wove each an
immortal shape, and bade it go forth out of
the room into the green world, to sing there
for ever and ever in the ears of man a rapturous
sweet song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Iosa,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;are these all thy brethren?
for each is fair as thee, and all have lit their
eyes at the white fire I see now in thy heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, before he spake, the room was filled
with music. I trembled with the joy, and in
my ears it has lingered ever, nor shall ever go.
Then I saw that it was the breathing of the
seventh and eighth, of the ninth and the tenth
of those star-eyed ministers of Iosa whom he
called the Twelve: and the names of them
were the Weaver of Laughter, the Weaver of
Tears, the Weaver of Prayer, and the Weaver
of Peace. Each rose and kissed me there.
&ldquo;We shall be with you to the end, little Art,&rdquo;
they said: and I took hold of the hand of one,
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
and cried, &ldquo;O beautiful one, be likewise with
the woman my mother,&rdquo; and there came back
to me the whisper of the Weaver of Tears:
&ldquo;I will, unto the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, wonderingly, I watched him likewise
take the shuttles that were ever the same and
yet never the same, and weave an immortal
shape. And when this Soul of Tears went
forth of the room, I thought it was my
mother&rsquo;s voice singing that rapturous sweet
song, and I cried out to it.</p>
<p>The fair immortal turned and waved to me.
&ldquo;I shall never be far from thee, little Art,&rdquo; it
sighed, like summer rain falling on leaves:
&ldquo;but I go now to my home in the heart of
women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were now but two out of the Twelve.
Oh the gladness and the joy when I looked
at him who had his eyes fixed on the face
of Iosa that was the Life! He lifted the
three shuttles of Beauty and Wonder and
Mystery, and he wove a Mist of Rainbows
in that room; and in the glory I saw that
even the dark twelfth one lifted up his eyes
and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O what will the name of you be?&rdquo; I cried,
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
straining my arms to the beautiful lordly one.
But he did not hear, for he wrought Rainbow
after Rainbow out of the mist of glory that he
made, and sent each out into the green world,
to be for ever before the eyes of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the Weaver of Hope,&rdquo; whispered
Iosa mac Dhe; &ldquo;and he is the soul of each
that is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I turned to the twelfth, and said
&ldquo;Who art thou, O lordly one with the shadow
in the eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he answered not, and there was silence
in the room. And all there, from the Weaver
of Joy to the Weaver of Peace, looked
down, and said nought. Only the Weaver
of Hope wrought a rainbow, and it drifted
into the heart of the lonely Weaver that was
twelfth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who will this man be, O Iosa mac
Dhe?&rdquo; I whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer the little child,&rdquo; said Iosa, and
his voice was sad.</p>
<p>Then the Weaver answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Weaver of Glory&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; he began,
but Iosa looked at him, and he said no
more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Art, little lad,&rdquo; said the Prince of Peace,
&ldquo;he is the one who betrayeth me for ever.
He is Judas, the Weaver of Fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at that the sorrowful shadow-eyed man
that was the twelfth took up the three shuttles
that were before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are these, O Judas?&rdquo; I cried
eagerly, for I saw that they were black.</p>
<p>When he answered not, one of the Twelve
leaned forward and looked at him. It was
the Weaver of Death who did this thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The three shuttles of Judas the Fear-Weaver,
O little Art,&rdquo; said the Weaver of
Death, &ldquo;are called Mystery, and Despair, and
the Grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that Judas rose and left the room.
But the shape that he had woven went forth
with him as his shadow: and each fared out
into the dim world, and the Shadow entered
into the minds and into the hearts of men,
and betrayed Iosa that was the Prince of
Peace.</p>
<p>Thereupon, Iosa rose and took me by the
hand, and led me out of that room. When,
once, I looked back I saw none of the Twelve
save only the Weaver of Hope, and he sat
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
singing a wild sweet song that he had learned
of the Weaver of Joy, sat singing amid a mist
of rainbows and weaving a radiant glory that
was dazzling as the sun.</p>
<p class="tb">And at that I woke, and was against my
mother&rsquo;s heart, and she with the tears upon
me, and her lips moving in a prayer.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1"><i>THE AWAKENING OF ANGUS OGUE</i></span></h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<h2><span class="h2line1">THE AWAKENING OF ANGUS OGUE</span></h2>
<p>One noon, among the hills, Angus Ogue
lay in sleep. It was a fair place where he
lay, with the heather about him and the
bracken with its September gold in it. On
the mountain-slope there was not a juniper
tall enough, not a rock big enough, to give
poise to a raven: all of gold bracken and
purple heather it was, with swards of the
paler ling. The one outstanding object was
a mountain ash. Midway it grew, and leaned
so that when the sun was in the east above
Ben Monach, the light streamed through the
feather-foliage upon the tarn just beneath:
so leaned, that when the sun was on the sea-verge
of Ben Mheadhonach in the west, the
glow, lifting upward over leagues of yellow
bracken, turned the rowan-feathers to the
colour of brass, and the rowan-berries into
bronze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>The tarn was no more than a boulder-set
hollow. It was fed by a spring that had
slipped through the closing granite in a dim
far-off age, and had never ceased to put its
cool lips round the little rocky basin of that
heather-pool. At the south end the ling fell
over its marge in a curling wave: under the
mountain-ash there was a drift of moss and
fragrant loneroid, as the Gaels call the bog-myrtle.</p>
<p>Here it was, through the tides of noon, that
Angus Ogue slept. The god was a flower
there in the sunflood. His hair lay upon the
green loneroid, yellow as fallen daffodils in
the grass. Above him was the unfathomable
sea of blue. Not a cloudlet drifted there,
nor the wandering shadow of an eagle
soaring from a mountain-eyrie or ascending
in wide gyres of flight from invisible lowlands.</p>
<p>Around him there was the same deep
peace. Not a breath stirred the rowan-leaves,
or the feathery shadows these cast
upon his white limbs: not a breath frayed
the spires of the heather on the ridges
of Ben Monach: not a breath slid along the
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
a&euml;rial pathways to where, on Ben Mheadhonach,
the sea-wind had fallen in a garth
of tansies and moon-daisies, and swooned
there is the sun-haze, moveless as a lapsed
wave.</p>
<p>Yet there were eyes to see, for Orchil
lifted her gaze from where she dreamed her
triune dream beneath the heather. The
goddess ceased from her weaving at the
looms of life and death, and looked broodingly
at Angus Ogue&mdash;Angus, the fair god,
the ever-young, the lord of love, of music,
of song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it time that he slept indeed?&rdquo; she
murmured, after a long while, wherein she
felt the sudden blood redden her lips and
the pulse in her quiet veins leap like a caged
bird.</p>
<p>But while she still pondered this thing,
three old Druids came over the shoulder of
the hill, and advanced slowly to where the
Yellow-haired One lay adream. These, however,
she knew to be no mortals, but three
of the ancient gods.</p>
<p>When they came upon Angus Ogue they
sought to wake him, but Orchil had breathed
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
a breath across a granite rock and blown
the deep immemorial age of it upon him, so
that even the speech of the elder gods was
no more in his ears than a gnat&rsquo;s idle
rumour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake,&rdquo; said Keithoir, and his voice was
as the sigh of pine-forests when the winds
surge from the pole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake,&rdquo; said Manannan, and his voice
was as the hollow booming of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake,&rdquo; said Hesus, and his voice was
as the rush of the green world through space,
or as the leaping of the sun.</p>
<p>But Angus Ogue stirred not, and dreamed
only that a mighty eagle soared out of the
infinite, and scattered planets and stars as
the dust of its pinions: and that as these
planets fell they expanded into vast oceans
whereon a myriad million waves leaped and
danced in the sunlight, singing a laughing
song: and that as the stars descended in a
silver rain they spread into innumerable
forests, wherein went harping the four winds
of the world, and amidst which the white
doves that were his kisses flitted through
the gold and shadow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;He will awake no more,&rdquo; murmured Keithoir,
and the god of the green world moved sorrowfully
apart, and played upon a reed the passing
sweet song that is to this day in the
breath of the wind in the grass, or its rustle
in the leaves, or its sigh in the lapping of
reedy waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will awake no more,&rdquo; murmured Manannan,
and the god of the dividing seas
moved sorrowfully upon his way; and on
the hillside there was a floating echo as of
the ocean-music in a shell, mournful with
ancient mournfulness and the sorrow-song of
age upon age. The sound of it is in the ears
of the dead, where they move through the
glooms of silence: and it haunts the time-worn
shores of the dying world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will awake no more,&rdquo; murmured Hesus;
and the unseen god, whose pulse is beneath
the deepest sea and whose breath is the frosty
light of the stars, moved out of the shadow
into the light, and was at one with it, so that
no eyes beheld the radiance which flowered
icily in the firmament and was a flame betwixt
the earth and the sun, which was a glory
amid the cloudy veils about the west and a
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
gleam where quiet dews sustained the green
spires of the grass. And as the light lifted
and moved, like a vast tide, there was a
rumour as of a starry procession sweeping
through space to the clashing cymbals of
dead moons, to the trumpetings of volcanic
worlds, and to the clarions of a thousand
suns. But Angus Ogue had the deep immemorial
age of the granite upon him, and
he slept as the dead sleep.</p>
<p>Orchil smiled. &ldquo;They are old, old, the
ancient gods,&rdquo; she whispered: &ldquo;they are so
old, they cannot see eternity at rest. For
Angus Ogue is the god of Youth, and he
only is eternal and unchanging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, before she turned once more to her
looms of life and death, she lifted her eyes
till her gaze pierced the brown earth and rose
above the green world and was a trouble
amid the quietudes of the sky. Thereat the
icy stars gave forth snow, and Angus Ogue
was wrapped in a white shroud that was not
as that which melts in the flame of noon.
Moreover, Orchil took one of the shadows of
oblivion from her mystic loom, and put it as
a band around Ben Monach where Angus
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
Ogue lay under the mountain-ash by the
tarn.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs3">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>A thousand years passed, and when for the
thousandth time the wet green smell of the
larches drifted out of Winter into Spring,
Orchil lifted her eyes from where she spun
at her looms of life and death. For, over the
shoulder of the hill, came three old Druids,
advancing slowly to where the Yellow-haired
One lay adream beneath the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake, Angus,&rdquo; cried Keithoir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake, Angus,&rdquo; cried Manannan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake, Angus,&rdquo; cried Hesus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake, awake,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;for the world
has suddenly grown chill and old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had the grey grief upon them, when
they stood there, face to face with Silence.</p>
<p>Then Orchil put down the shuttle of mystery
wherewith she wove the threads of her looms,
and spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O ye ancient gods, answer me this. Keithoir,
if death were to come to thee, what would happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The green world would wither as a dry
leaf, and as a dead leaf be blown idly before
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
the wind that knows not whither it
bloweth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manannan, if death were to come to thee,
what would happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deep seas would run dry, O Orchil:
there would be sand falling in the place of
the dews, and at last the world would reel
and fall into the abyss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hesus, if death were to come to thee,
what would happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There would be no pulse at the heart of
earth, O Orchil, no lift of any star against
any sun. There would be a darkness and a
silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Orchil laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when Angus Ogue
had the snow-sleep of a thousand years, none
knew it! For a thousand years the pulse of
his heart of love has been the rhythmic beat
of the world. For a thousand years the
breath of his nostrils has been as the coming
of Spring in the human heart. For a thousand
years the breath of his life has been
warm against the lips of lovers. For a
thousand years the memory of these has
been sweet against oblivion. Nay, not one
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
hath dreamed of the deep sleep of Angus
Ogue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; cried Keithoir. &ldquo;Is he older
than I, who saw the green earth born?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; cried Manannan. &ldquo;Is he
older than I, who saw the first waters come
forth out of the void?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; cried Hesus. &ldquo;Is he older
than I, who saw the first comet wander from
the starry fold; who saw the moon when it
was a flaming sun, and the sun when it was a
sevenfold intolerable flame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is older!&rdquo; said Orchil. &ldquo;He is the
soul of the gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that she blew a frith across the
palm of her hand, and took away the deep
immemorial age of the granite that was upon
the Fair God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake, eternal Spring!&rdquo; she cried. And
Angus awoke, and laughed with joy; and at
his laughing the whole green earth was veiled
in a snow of blossom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arise, eternal Youth!&rdquo; she cried. And
Angus arose and smiled; and at his smiling the
old brown world was clad in dewy green, and
everywhere the beauty of the world was sweet
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
against the eyes of young and old, and everywhere
the pulse of love leaped in beating hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go forth, eternal Hope!&rdquo; she cried. And
Angus Ogue passed away on the sunflood,
weaving rainbows as he went, that were fair
upon the hills of age and light within the
valleys of sorrow, and were everywhere a wild,
glad joy.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs3">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>And that is why, when Orchil weaves dumbly
in the dark: and Keithoir is blind, and dreams
among remote hills and by unfrequented shores:
and Manannan lies heavy with deep sleep, with
the oceans of the world like moving shadows
above him: and Hesus is grown white and
hoar with the frost of waning stars and weary
with the burden of new worlds: that is why
Angus Ogue, the youthful god, is more ancient
than they, and is for ever young. Their period
is set. Oblivion is upon the march against
their immemorial time. But in the heart of
Angus Ogue blooms the Rose of Youth, whose
beauty is everlasting. Yea, Time is the name
of that rose, and Eternity the beauty and
fragrance thereof.</p>

<p class="tb">&ldquo;<i>Not beauty alone, but that element of strangeness in beauty
which Mr Pater rightly discerned as the inmost spirit of
romantic art&mdash;it is this which gives to Miss Macleod&rsquo;s work
its peculiar &aelig;sthetic charm. But apart from and beyond all
those qualities which one calls artistic, there is a poignant
human cry, as of a voice with tears in it, speaking from out
a gloaming which never lightens to day, which will compel
and hold the hearing of many who to the claims of art as such
are wholly or largely unresponsive.</i>&rdquo; (<span class="sc">James Ashcroft

<p>&ldquo;<i>Of the products of what has been called the Celtic Renascence,</i>

<p>&ldquo;<i>For sheer originality, other qualities apart, her tales are as
remarkable, perhaps, as anything we have had of the kind
since Mr Kipling appeared.... Their local colour, their
idiom, their whole method, combine to produce an effect which
may be unaccustomed, but is therefore the more irresistible. They
provide as original an entertainment as we are likely to find in
this lingering century, and they suggest a new romance among
the potential things of the century to come.</i>&rdquo; (<span class="sc">The Academy.</span>)</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
